{'title': "'I was kidnapped in London and trafficked for sex'", 'author': '', 'body': 'Anna came to London from Romania intending to study, but first she needed to earn some money. She took temporary jobs - waitressing, cleaning, maths tutoring. Then one day in March 2011 she was snatched off the street, flown to Ireland and put through nine months of hell. Anna was nearly home. There was just enough time to nip inside and eat lunch before leaving for her next cleaning job. She was wearing headphones and listening to Beyoncé singing I Was Here as she walked down the street in Wood Green, north London. She was just a few doors away.  She reached into her bag to pull out her keys when suddenly someone grabbed her by the neck from behind, covered her mouth, and dragged into the back of a dark red car.  There were three of them, two men and a woman. They were slapping her, punching her, and screaming threats in Romanian. Her ears were ringing. The woman in the passenger seat grabbed her bag and pulled the glasses from her face. If she didn\'t do what they told her, they shouted, her family in Romania would be killed. "I didn\'t know what was happening or where they were taking me," Anna says. "I was imagining everything - from organ harvesting or prostitution, to being killed, to God knows what." The woman was going through her bag, looking in her wallet, scrolling through the recent calls and Facebook friends on her phone, looking at her papers. Her passport was there - she carried it everywhere after her previous one was stolen from her room. Anna could see there was no point trying to escape from the car, but when they arrived at an airport and she was left alone with just one of the men, she began to wonder if this was her chance. Could she appeal to airport staff for help? "It\'s hard to scream when you feel so threatened," she says. "They had my papers, they knew where my mum was, they knew everything about me." It was a risk she couldn\'t bring herself to take. At the check-in desk, she was crying and her face was red, but the woman behind the counter didn\'t seem to notice. When the man presented their passports, she just smiled and handed them boarding cards. Trying to pretend they were a couple, he rushed Anna through security to the boarding gates, and took seats right at the back of the plane. He told her not to move, not to scream and not to cry, or he would kill her.  Anna heard the captain announce that they were flying to an airport in Ireland - she\'d never heard of it. Her face was wet with tears as she walked off the plane, but like the woman at the check-in desk the air stewardess simply smiled. This time Anna had decided that once in the airport she would run, but it turned out to be no bigger than a bus station and two more Romanian men were waiting for them. The fat one reached out for her hand, smiled and said, "At least this one looks better." It was then that she realised why she had been kidnapped. "I knew, at that point, that I was going to be sold," she says. The men drove her to a dirty flat, upstairs, not far from a bookies. The car broke down on the way.  Inside, the blinds were closed and the air smelled of alcohol, cigarettes and sweat. Men smoked and looked at laptops in the living room. On the table more than a dozen mobile phones rang, buzzed and vibrated constantly, while girls wearing little or nothing came and went between rooms. Anna\'s clothes were ripped from her body by a woman wearing a red robe and flip flops, assisted by some of the men. And from then on she was brutalised. Pictures were taken of her in underwear in front of a red satin sheet pinned to the wall, so that she could be advertised on the internet. She was given more names than she can remember - she was Natalia, Lara, Rachel, Ruby. She was 18, 19, and 20, from Latvia, Poland, or Hungary. She was then forced to have sex with thousands of men. She didn\'t see daylight for months. She was only allowed to sleep when there were no clients but they came round the clock - up to 20 of them per day. Some days there was no food, other days maybe a slice of bread or someone\'s leftovers. Deprived of food and sleep, and constantly abused, she lost weight fast and her brain stopped working properly. Customers paid 80-100 euros for half an hour, or 160-200 euros for an hour. Some left Anna bleeding, or unable to stand, or in so much pain that she thought she must be close to death. Others would ask her if she knew where she was, if she\'d been out to hear the traditional music in the pubs, if she\'d visited the local beauty spots.  But she says they knew that she and the other girls were held against their will. "They knew that we were kept there," she says. "They knew, but they didn\'t care." It was obvious from the bruises which covered every inch of Anna\'s body - fresh ones appearing every day where older ones were beginning to fade away - and it didn\'t bother them. She hated them all. Find out more Anna spoke to Jo Fidgen on Outlook on the BBC World Service You can  listen again here In July, four months into Anna\'s captivity, the races were on and the phones were ringing more than ever. Then one day the police crashed into the flat and arrested all the girls. Mysteriously, the men and the woman who ran the show, had disappeared in advance with the laptops and most of the cash. Anna wondered how they had known the police were coming. The police took pictures of the flat, of the used condoms and the underwear and told Anna and the other three trafficked women to get dressed. She told them that they didn\'t have any clothes and that they were being held there against their will. "You could clearly see there were signs that we had no power over anything - no clothes, no identity papers," she says. "I tried to tell them, nobody listened." She was glad to be arrested, though. She felt sure the police would eventually realise that they were victims. But still they didn\'t listen. The four women spent the night in a cell and were taken to court the following morning. A solicitor explained there would be a brief hearing, they would be charged with running a brothel, fined, and freed a few hours later. It wasn\'t a big deal, he said. It was just part of the routine when the races were on - sex workers and sometimes pimps were arrested and released again. When the women left the court Anna had an impulse to run, though she knew she had nowhere to go and no money. She was given no chance, anyway - her captors were waiting for them outside, holding the car doors open. In Romania her mother read the headlines about the young women running a brothel in Ireland, her own daughter\'s name among them. By that stage she\'d already seen the photos the men had posted on Anna\'s Facebook account too - images of her naked or in ill-fitting lingerie, covered in bruises. Alongside them were comments in which Anna boasted about her new life and all the money she was making as a sex worker in Ireland. More lies, typed out by the men on their laptops. Not only had her mother seen these photographs, the neighbours had seen them, Anna\'s friends had seen them. None knew that she had been trafficked and was being held against her will. At first, her mother had tried to do something. But when she called her daughter there was never any answer. "My mum went to the police in Romania," Anna says. "But they said, \'She\'s over the age of consent and she\'s out of the country, so she can do whatever she wants.\'" Eventually, Facebook deleted her account because of the indecent images and if anyone looked for her on social media it would have seemed that she no longer existed. After the police raid, the four girls were moved around a lot, staying in different cities in different flats and hotels. But their lives remained as bad as ever - they continued to be abused at all times of day and night. Anna didn\'t think her situation could get any worse until she overheard her tormentors making plans to take her to the Middle East. She had to get away. "I still didn\'t really know exactly where I was," she says. "But I knew that I had a better chance of escaping from Belfast, or Dublin, or wherever they had me, than escaping from somewhere in the Middle East." She took the woman\'s flip flops and opened the door. She had to go very quickly and very quietly. She hadn\'t run or properly stretched the muscles in her legs for months, but now she had to move fast. What saved her was the fact that men occasionally asked for one of the women to be taken to them, rather than visiting the flat where they were held. Anna found these call-outs terrifying. "You didn\'t know what crazy person was waiting for you or what they would do to you," she says. "But any time I was out of that flat I would make mental maps of where I was. While they were transferring us from one point to another I would form maps in my mind - remembering the buildings, the street signs, and the things that we passed." There was also one man - Andy, a convicted drug dealer on a tag - who never wanted to have sex, only to talk. A friend of his was trying to break into the brothel-keeping business and he wanted information.  "I had to gamble at that point," Anna says. "I didn\'t trust him, but he offered me a place where I could hide." Relying on her incomplete mental map, Anna made it to Andy\'s address, only there was no answer. There was nothing to do but wait and hope that the pimps would not find her.  The gamble paid off. Andy had to return before midnight because of his tag. And he let her stay.  One of the first things Anna did was to call her mother. The phone rang, and her mother\'s partner answered. As soon as he realised who was calling he began urging her never to call again, and never to visit. They\'d received so many threats from the pimps and traffickers, her mother was now terrified, he said. "So I said to him, \'OK, I\'ll make it easy for you. If anybody rings you and threatens you just tell them that I\'m dead to you and to my mum,\'" Anna says. He hung up on her. At this point, despite having no papers or passport, and despite her experience of the brothel raid - when she had been prosecuted instead of rescued - Anna decided to contact the police. And this time, fortunately, they listened to her. It turned out that Anna was now in Northern Ireland, and she was told to attend a rendezvous with a senior policeman in a coffee shop. "He took one of those white paper napkins and asked me to write down the names of the people who did this to me on it," she says. When she pushed it back to him across the table she could see that he was shocked. He\'d been looking for those people for years, he said.  A two-year investigation followed. Eventually Anna\'s former captors were arrested, but she was so worried for her own safety and her mother\'s that she decided she couldn\'t testify against them in court. Another girl she\'d known from the flat did give evidence, though, and the gang were convicted of human trafficking, controlling prostitution and money laundering in Northern Ireland. Each of them was sentenced to two years. They served six months in custody before they were sentenced, then eight months in prison after being convicted, with the remainder spent on supervised licence. They had already served two years in a Swedish prison on the same set of offences involving one of the same victims. "I was happy that they were arrested but I wasn\'t happy about the sentences," she says. "I guess nothing in this life is fair." Where to get help If you suspect someone is a victim of human trafficking, contact the police - call 999 if it\'s an emergency, or 101 if it\'s not urgent. If you\'d prefer to stay anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. If you want confidential advice about trafficking before calling the police, there are a number of specialist organisations you can talk to: The Modern Slavery helpline 0800 0121 700, is open 24 hours a day. If you think a child is in danger of trafficking you can contact the the NSPCC\'s helpline 0808 8005 000. Later, with other women, Anna gave testimony to the Unionist politician, Lord Morrow, who had become so concerned about the increasing number of stories he heard about children and adults forced to work in brothels, farms and factories that he put forward a new bill to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act, passed in 2015, made Northern Ireland the first and only place in the UK where the act of buying sex is a crime. The act of selling sex, by contrast, was decriminalised. Anna takes satisfaction from her role in this process.  "This law helps the victim and it criminalises the buyer and the trafficker," she says. "So it destroys the ring."  If even a small percentage of the men who used to pay for sex are now discouraged from doing so, that\'s still a success, Anna argues. And people like her who are trafficked can live without fear, she says, because instead of being criminalised for being involved in prostitution, they\'re now more likely to benefit from support. In 2017, it also became illegal to buy sex in the Republic of Ireland, where Anna\'s horrific ordeal began. Her nine months in sexual slavery have left her permanently injured. Men damaged her body in the places where they penetrated her. Her lower back and knees constantly ache, and there\'s a patch at the back of her head where her hair stopped growing because it was pulled out so many times. She suffers from terrifying flashbacks. Sometimes she cannot sleep, and when she does sleep she has nightmares. And sometimes she still smells that smell, the alcohol, mixed with the cigarettes and the sweat, the semen, and the breath of her abusers. But she\'s looking forward now. She shopped the people who sold her body, she\'s helped change the law, and after years of not even speaking, her relationship with her mother is good. "Me and my mum had to go on a really long journey to get her to understand what happened to me," she says. "She had to learn from me and I had to learn from her, but now we are fine." Anna started a degree course in the UK but had to drop out because she couldn\'t afford the fees and didn\'t qualify for any funding. She now has a job in hospitality and it\'s going well. "I would love with all my heart to return to my studies at some point," she says. "But for now I have to work, work, work, and keep focused." All names have been changed.

{'title': 'Barcelona attack: The jihadists and the hunt for a second gang', 'author': '', 'body': 'A neighbour had just walked past when an explosion tore through a small, white house in the Spanish coastal town of Alcanar last August. Debris was flung hundreds of metres by the force of the blast and the bodies of two men landed in nearby gardens. A third man who had been on a roof terrace talking on his phone survived. The next day a van attack was launched on pedestrians in Barcelona\'s central tourist avenue, Las Ramblas. Hours later there was another attack, in Cambrils, a coastal town. Sixteen people died and more than 130 were injured.  Catalonia had come under attack from a jihadist gang of 11 people.  Investigators believe they had planned to target Barcelona\'s Sagrada Familia Cathedral and the Camp Nou stadium, home to Barcelona football club. The Eiffel Tower in Paris was another target. The Alcanar blast late on 16 August had changed all that and the key figure, Abdelbaki Es Satty, lay dead in the rubble. But this is also a story of missed clues and intelligence failings, because Es Satty had been known to the authorities for years.  And the BBC has learned that his gang of extremists was plugged into a network that, according to a surviving cell member, could have included another imam with a second cell of eight or nine young men in France. A year on, investigators in France have requested information from 10 countries and are still trying to break up that network and identify a possible French cell.  Catalonia\'s head of counter-terrorism believes the plot could have been masterminded by someone outside Spain. The story of Es Satty\'s gang As neighbours emerged from the destroyed buildings in Alcanar, no-one considered an extremist link. The bodies of Es Satty, 44, and 22-year-old Youssef Aallaa were identified. "The strongest hypothesis was that it was a drugs lab," said firefighter Jordi Bort, who was among the first on the scene. It was not until emergency services had dug through the rubble the next day that the full picture emerged.  There was a second blast, almost as large as the first. Nine firefighters were injured. They had stumbled on a bomb factory containing more than 200kg (440lb) of explosives. Much of it was extremely unstable, designed to cause multiple deaths. There were canisters, nails, large quantities of acetone, hydrogen peroxide, bicarbonate and detonator switches - all the ingredients to create TATP (triacetone triperoxide) explosive. They also found grenades and suicide vests.  Investigators only discovered later, from material recovered from digital cameras, computers and mobile phones, that the men had planned to use these explosives at some of Europe\'s biggest landmarks.  The attacks It was on the afternoon of 17 August that 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub jumped into a rented white van and zig-zagged down Las Ramblas at high speed, careering into pedestrians along the packed avenue. Witnesses said the driver had tried to hit as many people as possible.  Many were knocked to the ground while others fled for cover in nearby shops and cafes. Abouyaaqoub killed 13 people and injured more than 130 before fleeing on foot. He then hijacked a white Ford Focus, killing the driver. A German woman injured on Las Ramblas later died, taking the death toll to 15. Eight hours later, in the early hours of 18 August, five men drove to Cambrils, 100km (62 miles) down the coast from Barcelona. They were the Barcelona attacker\'s brother, Houssaine Abouyaaqoub, along with Moussa Oukabir, Said Aallaa and brothers Mohamed and Omar Hychami. Their black Audi A3 car ploughed into pedestrians at the seaside resort and overturned before the gang got out wielding knives and an axe.  A Spanish woman was killed and several others wounded. The attackers were wearing fake suicide vests adorned with plastic bottles to create panic. The vests also ensured they would be shot by police and, in their eyes, die as martyrs. Barcelona attacker Younes Abouyaaqoub was still on the run. His journey finally came to an end on 21 August in a field west of Barcelona. Police were tipped off by the public and Abouyaaqoub, wearing a fake explosives belt, was shot dead. The young men behind the attacks had claimed 16 lives. Who was behind these murders? Normal boys who turned to violence Ninety minutes\' drive inland from Barcelona, on the edge of the Pyrenees, lies the picturesque town of Ripoll. Surrounded by pine trees and mountain rivers, this is where most of the Catalan terror cell grew up. They were all first- or second-generation immigrants from Morocco and most were childhood friends who went to the same school. They included four sets of brothers. By all accounts they were normal kids who played in the local football teams, went to after-school clubs and took part in hiking trips. Cambrils attacker Houssaine Abouyaaqoub was known as Houssa and was part of the local football team. Social worker Nuria Perpinya helped some of them at a school homework club. "They would go there after school to use the computers because they didn\'t have a computer or any internet connection at home," she said.  "They were like all the kids," wrote Raquel Rull, the mother of one of Houssa\'s friends, in an emotional letter published after the attacks. "Like the one you see playing in the square, or the one who carries a big school bag filled with books, or the one who says \'Hi\' and lets you go first in the supermarket queue, or the one who gets nervous when a girl smiles at him." Apart from the older Es Satty, only Driss Oukabir, the eldest of the boys, was known to the authorities. He had a criminal record for robbery, sexual assault and domestic violence, but even then his conduct had attracted little attention. On leaving school, most of them had gone to work in local factories, cafes and restaurants. How Es Satty groomed a terror cell Then Abdelbaki Es Satty arrived and started working at one of the town\'s two mosques, saying he was an imam. Born in Morocco\'s Rif mountain region, he had come to Spain in the early 2000s and had been in and out of prison until he was brought to Ripoll by a Moroccan woodcutter during the spring of 2015. For Ibrahim Aallaa, whose sons Said and Youssef were killed at Alcanar and Cambrils, Es Satty was a "bad influence" and he did not like him. He had twice visited the house uninvited when he thought Ibrahim was not at home. Said had been working in a local cafe and Es Satty said he should stop as it served alcohol and pork.  Youssef had been told to stop working during Ramadan.  "Es Satty\'s belief was too strict," Ibrahim said. "It was an interpretation of Islam that I didn\'t like. I told my boys too. I didn\'t want them to go to the mosque and I didn\'t talk to Es Satty." By January 2016, Es Satty had left Ripoll in search of new opportunities. He went to Belgium to preach at a mosque in Diegem, outside Brussels. He had told leading members of the community he was an informant for the Spanish intelligence services. "They didn\'t trust him, they asked him for some papers to convince them that he actually was an imam," said Hans Bonte, mayor of Vilvoorde. "But he didn\'t have a record, so he couldn\'t give them." The head of the mosque went to the police and Es Satty\'s details were put on a national database by a local police officer. The case was due to be discussed by local and national security services, but the officer heard nothing back. The Belgian officer also approached a Catalan counterpart he knew but nothing came of that either. From plot to attack Despite local authorities twice flagging up their concerns, Es Satty returned to Ripoll in April 2016, soon after the Brussels bombings.  "There was a lack of information exchange between Catalan police and the federal Spanish police and that gave a lot of tension between Catalan and Spanish authorities," Mayor Bonte said. Es Satty was to return to Brussels several times. Back in Ripoll, Es Satty began work at the town\'s second mosque. A year before the events in Barcelona, friends of the Ripoll cell members began to notice a change in their behaviour. They stopped wearing branded clothing and visited the mosque more frequently. "They closed themselves up a little," said one. They also made regular trips to the bomb factory in Alcanar. One of the most frequent visitors was Younes Abouyaaqoub, the Barcelona attacker. The house was registered in his name and in Youssef Aalla\'s. In documents seen by the BBC, the cell searched online for chemistry manuals, various IS leading figures, bomb-making manuals and possible targets to attack. In order to fund the purchase of explosives and their travelling, they stole money from their places of work, and sold gold and jewellery in small towns on the coast. By now, older members of the Ripoll gang were travelling abroad and material found on computers and phones has revealed how the cell was linked to people known to authorities across Europe.  There were various trips to Morocco to visit friends and family, especially ahead of the attacks, and one visit to Austria. Es Satty repeatedly travelled to Belgium too, and was last seen there two months before the Catalonia attacks. But there were two other trips that investigators found particularly interesting. In December 2016 Youssef Aallaa and Mohamed Hychami flew to Basel in Switzerland and stayed at the Olympia Hotel in Zurich. Their aim was likely to discuss logistics or financing with figures connected to a controversial An\'Nur mosque. The mosque in Winterthur, which has since shut, denies such claims.  One week later, those two men joined Younes Abouyaaqoub - who would eventually become the Ramblas attacker - in Brussels. And days before the Ramblas attack, the man who carried it out, Younes Abouyaaqoub, went to Paris with Omar Hychami. They took the Audi which Hychami was in when it rammed pedestrians in Cambrils.  On 11 and 12 August the men\'s phones were tracked to central Paris as well as the city\'s Malakoff and Saint-Denis areas. They called contacts who were using pay-as-you-go Sim cards.  Who was in charge? Investigators believe the Paris trip was part of a mission to find targets for a second cell of jihadists. That target was to be the Eiffel Tower. The question is whether Es Satty and the Ripoll cell were part of something much larger and linked to wider extremist networks and plots in Europe. "We think there is some brain outside Spain," says Manel Castellvi, head of counter-terrorism in Catalonia, "maybe in Europe, or maybe in a conflict zone, who convinced them to carry out this attack." While the TATP explosives they amassed in Alcanar were relatively easy to get hold of, Mr Castellvi believes the quantity they had, as well as their ability to make the explosives, suggests "someone with important knowledge could have given information to the cell". The BBC has also learned that Es Satty had booked a flight from Barcelona to Brussels for October 2017 - suggesting Es Satty was not planning to kill himself like the others.  Why did they miss Es Satty? Es Satty had been known to intelligence agencies for years, but decisive action was never taken. When the alarm was raised in Brussels in 2016, there was a failure to communicate between Belgium and Spain, and within Spain itself. But the failings go back much further than that. Es Satty was on their radar for links to jihadists as early as 2005. He was living in Vilanova i la Geltru, a coastal town near Barcelona, and spent time with an Algerian man called Belgacem Belil. The pair were connected to a network known as the Vilanova cell.  Belil became a suicide bomber in Iraq, killing 28 people in November 2003.  Members of the cell were investigated for sending people to Syria and Iraq and were connected to people involved in the 2004 Madrid bombings. However, initial convictions handed down to them were quashed. Then, in 2005, Spanish authorities sought approval to tap Es Satty\'s phone. They believed he could be acting as an intermediary with individuals connected to militant group Ansar al Islam. Not finding enough evidence, the phone tap was lifted but, at some point, his name was added to a European database of people who support terrorism. In 2010 he was jailed in Castellon, south of Barcelona, for transporting cannabis between Morocco and Spain. While in prison, he was approached by Spain\'s National Intelligence Centre (CNI), most probably as a possible informant, but he was deemed unreliable. However, he was considered interesting enough for his phone to be tapped when he left prison, the BBC has learned. The CNI wanted to know if he was still in touch with extremists, but again the wire-tap was halted because a judge decided it had failed to yield relevant results. The warning signs were there and opportunities were missed.  Abdelbaki Es Satty took several years to move from the fringes of extremist Islam to become the ringleader of a murderous cell in rural northern Spain. Lessons have to be learned about exchanging information, says Manuel Navarrete, Europol\'s head of counter-terrorism. "Barcelona showed that we need to think in a different way about local actors, a local cell that became quite sophisticated."

The arresting officer, who is white, detailed in his official report how Lauren Cutshaw, 32, appealed to him for special treatment based on her race. When asked why, Ms Cutshaw replied: "You\'re a cop; you should know what that means," the report states. She was arrested on Saturday night and also charged with drug possession. Ms Cutshaw was pulled over after she drove through a stop sign at 60mph (96km/h) in Bluffton, South Carolina. As officers began investigating, she argued that she should not be arrested. Ms Cutshaw told officers she had perfect grades her whole life, was a cheerleader and sorority girl, had graduated from a "high accredited university" and that her partner was a police officer, according to a law enforcement report viewed by local news site  The Island Packet . The officer\'s report stated: "Making statements such as these as a means to justify not being arrested are unusual in my experience as a law enforcement officer and I believe further demonstrate the suspect\'s level of intoxication." When she was pulled over, Ms Cutshaw\'s blood alcohol level registered at 0.18% - the legal limit is 0.08% - and she failed sobriety tests.  Her eyes were bloodshot and glassy and she was slurring her words, police say. She reportedly told officers she only drank two glasses of wine at an upmarket restaurant, saying: "I mean, I was celebrating my birthday." Police also found marijuana and related paraphernalia in her car. According to the report, Ms Cutshaw said she "may have" smoked earlier that evening.

{'title': 'Matteo Salvini: Can Italy trust this man?', 'author': '', 'body': 'Standing smoking in his green puffer jacket, Matteo Salvini blended in with his bodyguards and aides.  Politicians in Italy tend to prefer the tailored suit and shirt, the kind that makes them stand out from their supporting cast. Not so Matteo Salvini. On the occasions he does put on a tie, it is almost invariably loosened at the collar. Outside the event in Rome, journalists waited politely as Salvini, in the middle of the 2018 general election campaign, smoked and checked his phone. "Why are you against migrants?" I asked him once he had finished his cigarette. "I\'m against  illegal  migrants," he corrected me. "Too many of them are dangerous for Italy and Europe." His words struck a chord with the electorate. Salvini\'s League party did better than expected at the polls. In June, he was sworn in as deputy prime minister and interior minister in a coalition government with the populist Five Star Movement. The two parties installed an unknown former law professor, Giuseppe Conte, as a relatively powerless prime minister. Salvini ended up becoming the most powerful figure in the government. It was the culmination of a political career that began when he was a teenager. He entered politics as a left-wing secessionist, before transforming himself into the leading spokesman of Italy\'s nationalist hard right. Salvini joined the Northern League at a time when it wanted independence from the rest of Italy. The party believed that the south of Italy was holding back the more affluent north, and its members enjoyed joking in their chants that southerners were dirty and lazy. "There\'s a bad smell / Even dogs are running away / Must be that the Neapolitans are arriving / They have cholera, are earthquake-hit / They never washed themselves with soap." In Italy, all political parties operate their own mini-states. Salvini found work in the Northern League\'s in-house newspaper and its radio station, taking his place on the movement\'s left wing - a point he advertised by wearing a Che Guevara pin. Alessandro Morelli is a close friend of Salvini who grew up alongside him and is now a fellow League member of parliament.  "We would always be involved in grassroots politics," he says. "We\'d put up posters, set up gazebos, distribute propaganda - we were always close to the people. Even then you could see he had the makings of a leader." All my relatives started booing. That was my wedding! In 1993, at the age of 20, Salvini was elected to Milan\'s city council. Six years later, with an early eye for a populist gesture, he refused to shake the hand of the visiting Italian president, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. "No thanks," he said. "You don\'t represent me." Salvini\'s anti-southern views even overshadowed his own 2003 wedding to Fabrizia Ieluzzi. The couple divorced in 2010. "It was crazy,"  she tells the BBC . "My origins are from Apulia, in southern Italy, and he\'s from the north. For a start, he had four relatives there, and I had 200. "When we were going to cut the cake he took his shirt off and put on a green one, the colour of The League, and all his friends started chanting [anti-Southern] League songs. And all my relatives, on the other side of the ballroom, started booing. That was my wedding!" Salvini went on to serve as a member of the European Parliament, but did not want to spend his entire career as a niche politician. A break-up of Italy - the Northern League\'s main focus - was not likely to happen. He wanted national power, which meant transforming the Northern League into an Italy-wide party. In 2013, when the party was on about 4% in the polls, he won its leadership. He gradually switched its focus: the principal enemy would no longer be the Italian state. Instead it would be the European Union. "When the wrong Europe was built, we realised that the enemy wasn\'t just Rome any more, but it had moved to Brussels," says Alessandro Morelli, the League MP and long-time Salvini ally. "Even further away, even less representative of Italians. For this reason, we realised that Brussels was the political enemy." Salvini dropped the \'Northern\' from The League\'s name and turned his party into a national movement. But, crucially, he retained the party\'s style - its easy-to-understand populist message that there were enemies threatening the people. In addition to Europe, he identified a second threat: immigration. Since 2014, more than 640,000 migrants have landed on Italy\'s shores - many have since left for other European countries, but others remain. "He\'s a chameleon, a politician who changes colour and shape according to his convenience and the political moment," says Matteo Pucciarelli, the author of Anatomy of a Populist: The True Story of Matteo Salvini. "Today he plays the right-wing sheriff. But knowing him privately, I know that that\'s not his real nature. That\'s a character. Some of the stuff he says in public is disturbing and scary, but the human side of Salvini is different. But this doesn\'t make it OK." Salvini demonstrated the two apparently contradictory skills that any successful populist politician needs: a core message, and the willingness to adapt or abandon this message whenever the need arises. He inherited an Italian political landscape shaped by the country\'s original populist, Silvio Berlusconi. The former prime minister had made himself his movement\'s biggest brand. So Salvini decided to do the same. This was a job he appeared to enjoy. He may well have figured that there was an opening. At the time, Italy was led by Matteo Renzi from the centre-left, a politician who modelled himself on Clinton, Blair and Obama. There was surely room in Italy for an anti-Renzi, someone who didn\'t spend his whole time leading seminars about globalisation. "For better or for worse, Salvini is the guy next door," says his biographer Matteo Pucciarelli. "He\'s the typical son of Italian parents, accessible, very simple, with whom you can speak about anything. "He lives in a suburb of Milan in a small flat," Pucciarelli adds. "He likes football, beautiful women, food and taking photographs of sunsets. He\'s the average Italian." Surprisingly, no-one else had occupied this space in Italian politics. Matteo Renzi was too much of a pro-globalist. The eternally ambitious Berlusconi may have spoken in an easy to understand way, but a billionaire collector of football teams and romantic affairs was hardly someone you\'d have a beer with. Beppe Grillo, the founder of the populist Five Star Movement, was too colourful to be normal. Renzi\'s eventual successor as prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, was a tinder-dry media-wary aristocrat, who might have been happier talking quietly about the history of frescoes. The more Salvini acted like a regular, albeit publicity-driven, Italian, the more he connected with the public. He also realised that politicians who spend most of their time talking about enemies also need to show a sense of fun. In December 2014, he posed half-naked on the cover of the gossip magazine \'Oggi\', wearing only the green tie of the League party. The headline said: "Would you trust Italy to this man?" Not yet, was the answer. But his party was rising in the polls. He continued to present his own phone-in show on the League\'s in-house radio station, Radio Padania. Given his many years presenting the phone-in, it may be that Salvini has answered more questions from the public than any other serving Italian politician. The risk is that he is legitimising the worst impulses of this country Like other populists, Salvini took to filming and posting his own videos and publicity stunts online. In May 2017, he filmed himself spending a night at the Mineo migrant centre in Sicily, the largest of its kind in Europe. The video of him going to bed in a migrant camp attracted attention. It served to highlight the words he would write after his visit: "I\'m increasingly convinced that there is an ongoing attempt of ethnic replacement of one people with another people. This is not emergency migration, but organised migration that aims at replacing the Italian people with other people, Italian workers with other workers." Salvini\'s assertion refers to a corner of conspiracy theory occupied by those who have long believed that European elites have a detailed plan to replace their own workers with migrants. "Salvini uses words and ideas that were first developed in extreme right wing circles," says Valerio Renzi, the author of \'Bulldozer Politics: Salvini\'s League and the European Right\', "For example, the fight against the alleged attempt to ethnically replace the European peoples. This is a conspiracy theory. Salvini translates these ideas into television language - ideas that were born in incubators of the extreme right in Italy and Europe." Salvini sells his message with a mixture of jokes and apocalyptic warnings. "How many migrants are you hosting at home?" he joked with a co-presenter on Radio Padania, in April 2014. "Do you eat bananas? These days if you don\'t eat bananas you\'re a racist." "150 migrants are coming into Veneto this week, distributed among the region," he told listeners to his phone-in show in Feb 2015. "This is ethnic replacement co-ordinated by Europe." During the 2018 general election campaign, he called migrants "an army of benefit thieves and criminals". "The risk is that he is legitimising the worst impulses of this country," says Salvini\'s biographer Matteo Pucciarelli.  "Up until a few years back, people were ashamed of saying certain things about migrants, of speaking openly about earning the right to shoot a burglar. With Salvini there\'s total freedom. From a cultural perspective, he has opened the gates to very negative impulses that maybe were always around but weren\'t visible." In each country, words and phrases carry their own memories. Salvini\'s direct language reminds some Italians of the Mussolini era in the 1920s and 30s, when insults were followed by the formalised persecution of minority groups. In particular, Salvini\'s suggestion that the Roma communities of Italy be subjected to their own census was a reminder of the 1938 race laws passed under Mussolini. This is not to accuse Salvini himself of fascism. It\'s simply to say that his words tap into a long historical memory. Discussion of these ideas does not happen in isolation. In February 2018, a former local candidate for The League injured six migrants in a drive-by shooting. Migrants, and those who speak out in favour of migration, now fear for their own safety. Laura Boldrini, the speaker of the lower house of parliament from 2013 to 2018, has become a particular target of Salvini\'s verbal attacks. Salvini depicts Boldrini, who was once the Rome spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as the symbol of everything he is trying to bring down. "Every time a migrant committed a crime, or there was a crime, a rape, a robbery, he would refer to migrants as \'Boldrini\'s resources\'," the former speaker tells me. "People were blaming me. It was awful. I received really violent rape and death threats. This campaign had implications on my life. I needed a security detail. You never know when [the threats] are real or not." "Stop bullying migrants," she urges him. "Start working on the real problems. Try to be competent and reliable. Stop using social media in that aggressive way. Be serious. [Act like] a minister." Many Italians on the centre-left share Boldrini\'s thoughts. But it\'s unlikely to make much of an impact on its target. Salvini\'s friends say that he\'s good at disregarding criticism. "He laughs at all the jokes that circulate about him," says his former wife Fabrizia Ieluzzi. "I never saw him get offended by a joke they make about him. I don\'t know how he does it, but he\'s good at letting these things go." But that\'s not always the case. Salvini\'s skin may be thinner than his allies claim. In July 2018, he began legal proceedings against the writer Roberto Saviano after Saviano accused him of aiding the mafia. The League\'s leader shares a derision of liberal critics with his growing number of allies in fellow nationalist movements in the West. Salvini has routinely voiced his support for Marine Le Pen in France, as well as for President Trump. He\'s also been pictured in Red Square in Moscow happily wearing a Putin T-shirt. In 2014, he went to North Korea and declared afterwards: "I\'m happy I went. There\'s a splendid sense of community. There\'s a lot of children playing in the streets and not with their Playstations." Shortly after taking office, Salvini announced ambitions to create a pan-European association of nationalist parties, capable of changing the direction of the European Union. This sets him up in direct opposition to France\'s President Emmanuel Macron, the de facto leader of the continent\'s liberal movements. The Salvini-Macron competition may come to define the future of the European Union. Early days are often full of broad promises. Matteo Salvini certainly seems to enjoy the crush of controversy and the attention. He is regularly seen taking selfies with those keen to pose with him. In previous years, many ordinary Italians would have been extremely reluctant to stand alongside the standard-bearer of a northern-led party which denigrated southerners, Europeans, and migrants. But Italy has changed. For now, this is Matteo Salvini\'s country. Italy has a habit, however, of rejecting those it once embraced as saviours. "I don\'t think it can last in the long term," says Salvini\'s biographer Matteo Pucciarelli. "This continuous cycle of launching attacks, diverting attention, creating illusions, changing the perception of reality... It may work to gain consensus to reach government, but it can\'t last when you\'re in government."', 'category': 'news', 'date': '5 August 2018'}

{'title': "Boris Johnson's burka jibe: Why do some Muslim women wear the veil?", 'author': '', 'body': 'Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas "look like letter boxes" and for comparing them to "bank robbers" - prompting calls for him to apologise and  be expelled from the Conservative Party . But Mr Johnson\'s comments, which some believe will aggravate Islamophobic tensions in the UK, have also highlighted some confusion about what a burka is - as the veil revealing just the eyes is, in fact, known as a niqab. So what actually are the differences between the various types of Islamic dress for women and what governs their choices?  The Koran, Islam\'s holy book, tells Muslims - men and women - to dress modestly. Male modesty has been interpreted to be covering the area from the navel to the knee. For women it is generally seen as covering everything except their face, hands and feet when in the presence of men they are not related or married to. However, there has been much debate within Islam as to whether this goes far enough. This has led to a distinction between the hijab (literally "covering up" in Arabic) and the niqab (meaning "full veil"). The  hijab  is typically a scarf that covers the hair and neck, whereas the  niqab  is a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear. It is worn with an accompanying headscarf or  abaya , a full-length robe, and sometimes with a separate transparent eye veil.  The  burka  is the most concealing - covering the entire face and body, leaving just a mesh screen to see through. Is it a woman\'s choice to cover up? UK mother-of-seven Tahira Noor, who has been wearing a burka for 20 years, says it\'s "100% my choice" and Mr Johnson\'s comments show a "lack of knowledge". The "majority of the women who wear the burka" she says, are born and brought up in Britain. They are "educated in this country, they\'ve been to colleges, universities, and have understood why they want to do what they\'re doing,"  she told BBC Radio 5 Live . "They\'re under no oppression, they\'re not doing it because their husbands want them to or their fathers want them to." Ms Noor has four daughters none of whom wear a burka. "I haven\'t forced my daughters into it because I don\'t have to," she said. "It\'s not a must. It\'s not an obligation. However... [it] gets you closer to God. It\'s a spiritual thing more than anything else." She is "not under an obligation" to cover her face but does so because it is "emulating" the Prophet Muhammad. So, how does she respond if asked to remove her covering for security reasons? "I\'m happy to take my veil off," she said, citing the example of being asked to at a bank. "When I travel, and I do travel, sometimes I don\'t even wear [it] because I think it\'s a lot easier not to [for] security reasons. "To make comments that they (women who wear burkas) look like bank robbers, I don\'t think it\'s fair." Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, wears the niqab but told BBC News she sometimes gets verbal abuse from others for her choice of veil. "A week ago someone abused me and said \'you\'re an ugly terrorist\' when I tried to park my car near where I live," she said. "Two years ago, when I was passing by one department to another at Heath Hospital, someone passed by and said \'don\'t cut off my head you\'re ISIS\'. It\'s quite painful [to hear]." In 2014, BBC News\' Shaimaa Khalil wrote about why she  stopped wearing her headscarf, only to put it back on again  when she became the Pakistan correspondent. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who lives in New York, does not wear a face veil and supports a ban on them. She said the number of women wearing them in the West is increasing in part because girls begin to wear them before they reach puberty and many were not given a choice.    What is the religious justification? Muslim scholars have long debated whether it is obligatory to wear the burka or niqab, or whether it is just recommended. There have also been more liberal interpretations which say any headscarf is unnecessary, as long as women maintain the sartorial modesty stipulated in the Koran. That holy text addresses "the faithful women" who are told to shield their private parts and not to display their adornment "except what is apparent of it". Scholarly disputes revolve around what this last phrase means. Does it refer to the outer surface of a woman\'s garments, necessitating that she cover every part of her body - ie don the full niqab? Or does it give an exemption referring to the face and the hands, as well as conventional female ornaments such as kohl, rings, bracelets and make-up? The latter interpretation has been adopted by some of the most prominent scholars from Islamic history who favour the hijab - headscarf - option. There are additional Koranic instructions - seen as ambiguous and therefore much debated - for women to draw the "khimar" (scarf) to cover the "jayb" (bosom/upper chest), and for "the wives and daughters of the Prophet and the women of the believers to draw their "jalabib" (cloaks) close round them". How many women wear the full-face veil in the UK? When contacted by BBC Reality Check, both the Women\'s Muslim Council and Faith Matters (an organisation which promotes integration) said accurate numbers weren\'t available for the UK.  But there does seem to be consensus that the figure is likely to be low.  Dr Omar Khan, director at the Runnymede Trust, a think tank that deals with race equality, said that it is likely to be "less than 1% [of the Muslim female population] - how much less is difficult to know". Sunder Katwala, director of think tank British Future,  acknowledged a lack of a "robust methodology" , but said there was a "ballpark estimate in region of 3,000-5,000" with it "very unlikely to be as high as 1-2%" of the female Muslim population.  These are both estimates by experts working in relevant fields, but until specific research is carried out, it will be difficult to know how prevalent the full-face veil is.  What we do know is that in the 2011 census, Muslims represented 4.8% of the population of England and Wales.  Using the most recent population estimates, this would mean there are roughly 1.43m Muslim women living in the two countries.  If the number of Muslim women wearing the niqab were to be as high as 1% - this would equate to just over 14,000 women - but, again, the 1% figure is just an estimate.  In other European countries, the figure also appears to be low. In 2009, a French Interior Ministry report estimated that just 0.1% of French Muslim women wore full-face veils which, at the time, equated to 1,900 women.  In Austria, a ban of full face veils in public spaces was said to affect just 0.03% of the Muslim population, according to Nilufar Ahmed, a  senior lecturer in public health  at Swansea University.  In Belgium between 150 and 200 women wore the niqab before a ban came into force, says Michael Privot, director of the European Network Against Racism.  Between 150 and 200 women in Demark - which banned face veils in public this month - wore a niqab or burqa on a daily basis.  That\'s 0.1% of  Muslim women  in the country, according to the Guardian. What are the laws or customs regarding face veils in other countries? While  Boris Johnson\'s comments  about Islamic face veils have provoked consternation among some, his defenders have said they were made as part of an argument against banning such garments. Other countries though, have taken this step. France  was the first European country to ban full-face veils - ie burkas and niqabs - in public places in April 2011, seven years after it introduced a law prohibiting conspicuous religious symbols in state schools. It was followed a few months later by  Belgium , which banned the wearing of partial or total face veils in public on the grounds of security. Full or partial bans on full-face veils have since been in place in  Austria ,  Bulgaria , the southern German state of  Bavaria  and, since 1 August,  Denmark . There have been protests against Denmark\'s new law, which does not mention burkas and niqabs by name, but says "anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine". Repeat offenders could be fined 10,000 ($1,500; £1,200) kroner. By contrast, in  Iran  the law requires women to wear modest "Islamic" clothing. In practice, this means women must wear a chador, a full-body cloak, or a headscarf and a manteau (overcoat) that covers their arms. There are posters in cities and towns comparing unveiled women to unwrapped candy and lollipops attracting unwanted attention from flies. Recently, some Iranian women have protested against this law by taking off their headscarf in public. One woman was jailed for two years in March for doing this.', 'category': 'news', 'date': '8 August 2018'}

{'title': 'India Assam: Will four million people really be deported?', 'author': '', 'body': 'Some four million people have effectively lost their citizenship in India\'s north-eastern state of Assam. They were left off a list of proven citizens, which was created as part of a government drive to identify illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh.  Here\'s what led to that controversial move, and what might happen next. How did the list come about? Fears over illegal migration from Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, have long been alive in Assam. The state\'s very first list of citizens - formally known as the National Register of Citizens, or NRC - was published in 1951, just four years after the partition of India, when millions of people had crossed into India from East Bengal, which had become a part of Pakistan.  The list was drawn up in response to nationalist groups in Assam who were afraid of an influx of Muslim immigrants changing the state\'s Hindu-majority demographics. But the problem re-emerged in the 1970s. After Bangladesh declared independence and broke away from Pakistan on 26 March 1971, sparking a bitter war, millions again fled to neighbouring India. And many of the refugees settled in Assam. By 1979, a movement against illegal immigrants led by the All Assam Students Union (AASU) took hold. The agitation turned violent in 1983 when mobs killed more than 2,000 suspected immigrants, most of whom were Muslims.  AASU and some other regional groups eventually signed an agreement in 1985 with the federal government led by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.  It said that anyone who could not prove that they were living in Assam by 24 March 1971 would be expelled from electoral rolls and considered illegal immigrants.  But the accord was never implemented.  So why is it being updated after all these years? In 2009, a man named Aabhijeet Sharma petitioned the Supreme Court, asking that the NRC be updated. In 2014, the court instructed the federal government to do so by 31 January 2016.  However given the magnitude of the exercise - which involved the verification of documents belonging to more than 32 million people - the first draft of the NRC was only published in December 2017.   The second draft was published on 30 July.  Who is on the list? The NRC contains the names of people who have been able to prove that they arrived in Assam on or before 24 March 1971. Everyone in the state had to submit documents to prove their claim to citizenship, including land and tenancy records, voter IDs or passports.  Those who were born after 1971 were asked to submit documents that proved that their parents or grandparents had settled in India before the cut-off date.  Around four million people did not make the list. Their names could be deleted from electoral rolls as they are not considered legitimate citizens. What has the reaction been? It has been mixed.  Many Hindus across the country have hailed it as a bold move and praised the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for implementing it when other state governments did not have the "guts" to do so.  Some feel that it is a political masterstroke ahead of upcoming national elections in 2019. But opposition parties have roundly denounced the move and criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for separating families and effectively making millions of people stateless overnight. Rahul Gandhi, leader of the main opposition Congress party, said the list had created "massive insecurity" among people. And Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of neighbouring West Bengal state, has been its most vocal critic. She predicted a "bloodbath" and said the exercise was making a mockery of democracy. "It seems like the BJP is using the issue to polarise voters and reinforce its anti-Muslim rhetoric - and opposition parties have reacted to the bait," Subir Bhaumik, author of Troubled Periphery, a study of India\'s troubled north-east, told the BBC.  But Indian officials have insisted that the process is "not targeting Muslims". Prateek Hajela, the NRC head, told BBC Urdu that those excluded were "people from different religions and groups".  Home Minister Rajnath Singh told the upper house of parliament that the process was "fair and transparent" and that "no Indian citizen would be left out". Is this a final list? No. The government has been very categorical about this. Home Minister Singh has made it clear that people can appeal against their non-inclusion. They can also submit more documents to claim citizenship in the coming months. So there is a chance that an updated list will carry their names. And activists say is a necessary move.  The NRC has already produced some surprising results - former servicemen, current political leaders and even some government employees, including one tasked with compiling the NRC - have not found their names on the list.  News reports have pointed out how  minor spelling errors have led to documents being rejected . Others mention how some families have seen   one sibling making it on to the list while another did not .  Assam also has a history of flooding, which means that many families have often lost official documents along with other belongings.  Will there be mass deportations? It is unclear - but also unlikely at the moment, say experts.  Mr Modi has consistently said that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported.   But the BBC\'s India columnist, Soutik Biswas, says Bangladesh will "definitely not accede to such a request" . Instead, he adds, there is a chance that India will end up "creating the newest cohort of stateless people" - similar to the Rohingyas of Myanmar. There are currently half a dozen detention camps in Assam, which house some 1,000 people. In July,  the state government said it had permission to build a new detention centre  for those unable to prove their citizenship, the Indian Express reports. India has no official treaty with Bangladesh in relation to the NRC or cross-border illegal immigration.  Regional security expert Seshadri Chari says that Bangladesh has always maintained that the NRC is an "internal matter and not a bilateral issue between the two countries".  He adds: "This underscores Bangladesh\'s resolve to not accept even one single illegal migrant that India may want to deport." Are there fears of violence? There has been concern over the safety of those whose names are not on the list.  While the government has not released any data on their religious identities, the majority of them are believed to be Bengali-speaking Muslims.  But there have been no protests or incidents of violence so far.  "Who is going to protest? Those in Assam who have pushed for it are feeling vindicated right now," Mr Bhaumik says. "And those whose names are not on the list are preoccupied with trying to get on it." A final list which is to be compiled after addressing all appeals and challenges could trigger violence, says the BBC\'s Nitin Srivastava, who has been reporting on the NRC in Assam.   "That is when they will be concerned about losing their land, voting rights and freedom."  Reporting by Krutika Pathi', 'category': 'news', 'date': '9 August 2018'}

{'title': 'The scuba dive that crushed my spine', 'author': '', 'body': 'It had been planned - a deep dive for four experienced scuba diving instructors. But halfway through the session, two compressed air tanks ran out, setting off a catastrophic chain of events. The sky was blue over Cyprus. It was a rare day off for friends Rich, Paul, Emily and Andy and they decided to take advantage of the crystal blue water and search for nudibranchs, a type of sea slug. They launched a boat from the shore, anchored it and dived into the sea one-by-one, using their fins to propel themselves downwards into the deeper, darker, water.  They carried on to depth of 40m - 10m deeper than the instructors would take their clients.  They were young and wanted to "push the limits", Rich Osborn, then 21, admits. But they were experienced and well-practised at this level. As they started to explore their surroundings, two of the group unexpectedly signalled to the others that their tanks had run dry. Osborn felt "absolute surprise" at this turn of event. But they were trained for such eventualities. There was no need to panic.  The divers used hand signals and underwater slates and pencils to write notes and arranged to share the remaining two tanks of air "breath for breath" as they ascended to the surface. The quartet started to rise slowly, but at 30m, cold dread swept through them. They had all run out of air. "We were frantically trying to sign to one another, scribbling down notes, thoughts and plans. From there you get a little bit panicked - a mix of fear and the unknown." The group had a decision to make - drown, or rocket to the surface and risk decompression sickness. "We took one last breath," says Osborn. Listen to the podcast:  \'Do we drown or rocket to the surface?\' A full transcript is  available here . For more Disability News, follow BBC Ouch on  Twitter  and  Facebook , and  subscribe to the weekly podcast . Osborn had grown up in Edinburgh. He was outdoorsy and into mountain biking and hiking. He took up scuba diving at the age of 14, and by the time he was 18 he was a qualified instructor. As a university engineering student, he would spend his holidays working with a diving company just outside Ayia Napa in Cyprus.  He taught classes and took groups of certified divers to see local reefs and shipwrecks.  "I had friends there. It was quite a nice lifestyle, sunny every day," he says. The town was "picture-postcard" - fantastic beaches, dramatic cliff faces - with a "chilled vibe". He was "living the dream". It all changed on 23 August 2009. As Osborn took his final breath, the mouthpiece felt tight around his mouth. It was a sure sign there was nothing left in the tank.  The group needed to ascend as "quickly as humanly possible" but in a controlled, slow, manner to minimise the risk of decompression sickness - also known as the bends - and remember to exhale continually so as not to stretch their lungs. "Everything in your body is screaming to get to the surface so you can breathe," he says.  "It\'s an internal battle. We tried to slow it as much as possible, but some people had the fear kick in and they were trying to go a little bit faster than we would like." They shot to the surface more quickly than planned, desperate for air. "It all went very, very fast," Osborn says. "But I knew near enough instantly what had happened." As he surfaced, his back started to tighten. From there he started to vomit and his coordination went.  "With the sky being blue and the sea being blue, I was disoriented and rolling around and trying to get some breath." The group started to swim back to shore, but Osborn\'s legs slowed and eventually stopped.  He was helped out of the water by some other divers and taken to a hyperbaric, or recompression, chamber on the island. Time was of the essence, but it was a four-hour drive away. "By that time, the damage was done," Osborn says. He was sealed into the chamber, which mimicked the pressure he had felt 30m under water. The pressure was slowly reduced while pure oxygen was administered to recalibrate his body.  Under water, the nitrogen in the air we breathe has difficulty leaving the body and bubbles build up due to the pressure. If the diver returns to the surface too quickly, the pressure is rapidly lessened but the bubbles don\'t have time to dissipate. It\'s like opening a fizzy drink. Shake it up and open it slowly and the bubbles fizz safely out. Open it fast and the bubbles explode uncontrollably. When this happens in the body, it blocks blood flow, stretches and tears blood vessels and nerves, and gets trapped in joints such as elbows.  The consequences vary from itchy skin to paralysis or death. Osborn spent six hours a day, for a week, in the recompression chamber to dissolve the trapped bubbles before he was flown to Glasgow\'s spinal unit for further tests and MRI scans. "All the doctors got together, looked at the evidence, and then it was relayed to me that there wouldn\'t be any prospect of walking again," he says. "The nitrogen bubbles got caught in my spinal column, and as I came up to the surface they expanded and crushed my spinal cord." Osborn was told his injury was "T4 incomplete" the four referring to his fourth vertebrae in the thoracic part of his spine. "Incomplete" means that he has some motor and sensory function - he can flex his right ankle and is able to feel some sensation. "I can\'t walk at all. I\'m in a wheelchair all the time," he says. "I\'m a paraplegic, which means I still have arm function, but leg function is gone and some internal organs have a bit of paralysis." About 40,000 people are affected by spinal cord injury in the UK, which is a permanent condition.  "This is the new normal and you just embrace it. You take what life throws at you and then you put a positive spin on it," says Osborn. He spent time at a rehabilitation unit and admits there were "moments when it was frustrating". "One thing would seem to lead onto another thing and it would just be an awful day," he says. "I\'m very good at compartmentalising stuff, so I just maybe cry it out, go to sleep and then wake up the next day and it\'s a new day and then you just go from there." Of the four divers that day, Paul and Emily suffered no adverse effects, while Andy had problems with one of his arms. He also spent some time in the chamber to repair the damage. The quartet remain in contact and say a bond formed between them because of what they went through.  They now know that what happened was "a disparity between what was planned in terms of breathing rates and what actually happened on the dive".  It was unpredictable. The life-changing injury did not put Osborn off outdoor pursuits. In fact, he turned to them to build his strength and continue his rehabilitation.  He got involved in swimming, basketball and hand cycling. Twelve months after the accident he returned to scuba diving and now teaches other disabled divers.  Earlier this summer, now aged 30, he took on the Snowdon Push Challenge where teams climb Snowdon - the highest mountain in Wales - with one team member in a wheelchair. Osborn\'s team completed the challenge in just over seven hours and raised £5,200 for the spinal injury charity Back Up, which had taught him skills such as how to tackle kerbs and ramps.  But it meant more than that.  "I got that feeling back of a sense of achievement and being at one with the elements again," he says.

{'title': "Touring a county with 'special energy' - using a 1939 guidebook", 'author': '', 'body': 'In 1939, the newly established Penguin Books published six guides to English counties, complete with touring maps, aimed at the middle-class motorist. Emma Jane Kirby has been driving around the UK with those first-edition guides in her hand to see how Britain has changed since the start of World War Two. Next stop: Somerset. "To tell the story of Glastonbury is difficult," protests my Penguin guide\'s pernickety author, "so cunning is the mixture of legend and history." For the classically trained schoolmaster, S E Winbolt, today\'s Glastonbury might test his narrative powers further still, and especially on market day.  I\'ve only been strolling the main thoroughfare for 15 minutes and I\'ve already been offered the chance to have my chakras spring-cleaned, a three-for-two deal on incense sticks and I\'m now getting guidance on whether to buy a rather beautiful hand-crafted wand.  "Birch is best for you," advises Howard the heavily tattooed wand maker thoughtfully, giving me the once-over. "Nothing too powerful to start with." Howard, who spent most of his pre-wand-making career as a psychiatric nurse at Broadmoor, agrees that back in 1939, Glastonbury market would have been unlikely to be selling wands - which he thinks is a pity, as he makes each of his with a lot of love and a fair bit of sustainable, locally sourced wood.  We glance around the other stalls with their crystals, stones and tarot-card readings and, hitting my head on a dream catcher as I turn (Howard assures me it\'s not unlucky) I reflect that the very essence of Glastonbury has been completely transformed over the past 80 years. Howard shakes his head. "Glastonbury\'s always had its moments," he corrects me. "It has a special energy."  It also has a very special music festival, of course, although this year the Glastonbury Festival is in a fallow year.  Had a time machine been available to transport S E Winbolt forward into summer 2018, however, I\'m not sure he would have felt he was missing out.   "No," agrees Howard. "The traffic\'s terrible."  All the Penguin county guides are based around church-visiting, but Winbolt\'s passion for ecclesiastical architecture is perhaps in a class of its own. His pages are peppered with erudite information about north perpendicular windows, Norman towers, triple sedilia and rood-loft doorways, which he appeals to his readers to please "note" and "admire". 1939 Glossary I Sedilia  - a group of three stone seats for clergy, set in the wall of a church Rood loft  - a gallery or platform at the top of a rood screen, which in some churches separates the nave and the chancel Chancel  - part of a church near the altar reserved for clergy and the choir, often at the east end At North Curry, he persuades me that "it is well worth making a detour" to see the church and of course he\'s quite right. The church of St Peter and St Paul is a bucolic gem and inside I duly "note" the effigy of the 14th Century lawyer and, in the north aisle, another of a monk creepily reduced to skeleton form. I also note that despite their entirely positive nature, the recent entries in the visitors\' book are rather few and far between. Alas for S E Winbolt, the 21st Century holidaymaker appears to be looking for something a little more thrilling than chancels and bench ends, however exquisitely carved. "I\'m going to chuck up!" screams a schoolgirl delightedly as the fairground ride on Weston-super-Mare\'s Grand Pier catapults her and her friends into the air. "Oh my days, this is brilliant!"  Winbolt promises that the "air of Weston is a fine tonic" but I\'m already catching a waft of candyfloss, chips and burgers, with perhaps the faintest hint of… is that whelks?  Find out more Listen to Emma Jane Kirby\'s report from Somerset for  the World at One on BBC Radio 4 Scroll down for links to her reports from  Kent, Derbyshire, Cornwall and the Lake District Weston\'s tourism manager, Caroline Darlington, has the excellent idea of abandoning the rides, slot machines and zombie interactive video games to head for a quieter area by the railings at the pier\'s edge. There, a few querulous seagulls dive-bomb a sign that warns tourists not to feed the birds because they can be extremely aggressive. They begin to circle a sleeping sunbather in her deckchair like vultures.  "In 1939, the railway companies used to advertise Weston-super-Mare as having air like wine!" Darlington informs me as we settle on some stools looking out over the mudflats. She shows me tourist information leaflets on Somerset\'s churches and guided heritage walks. She assures me that a few people do still ask for them but admits that today\'s tourist generally has different priorities. "Your 1939 guide barely mentions children. It was about what adults wanted," she says. "Now it\'s all about the family holiday. And today\'s children, with all the TV and advertising they\'re exposed to, do want a bit more than sitting on the beach staring at seagulls. They\'re looking for activity like the waterpark or adventure park and the fun rides."  Winbolt referred to Weston as a "most astonishing mushroom" that suddenly grows in the holiday season. And it still is.  In the first week of July, even before the school holidays, up to 200,000 holidaymakers strolled up the grand pier, possibly (or possibly not) lured by a giant poster advertising The Wurzels in concert. (What a pity Winbolt missed out on that!) On the huge, wide sands, the promise of donkey rides has several primary school children shrieking with delight. Darlington tells me that some of the families operating the donkey rides established their businesses as far back as the 19th Century.  "This scene replicates exactly what you\'d have seen in the summer of 1939," she laughs as we watch a barefoot little boy and girl jigging around excitedly in the saddles of Rose and Minnie. Not quite. As the handler patiently helps the children put their sandy feet in the stirrups, I notice they thank him shyly in Russian.  Winbolt may not have predicted foreign tourism but he did fear industrial competition from overseas. Particularly when it came to the business of weaving baskets from willow shoots known as osiers. "Women and children strip the osiers in a brake and bundle them into wads getting four pence a wad," he wrote knowledgeably. "Will the industry stand up to foreign competition?" "Well, there are only three willow-growing businesses round these parts now," says Nicola Coates as she welcomes me to her beautiful willow farm near Taunton. "But we\'re still here and still very busy!" (She adds a hasty disclaimer that child labour is no longer used.) We stroll down towards the 100 acres of beautiful willow beds with Coates\'s spaniel, Floss, proudly leading the way down a shady path that\'s animated with intricate wicker sculptures. Coates shows me the youngest of the plantation beds, which was planted last year and which she expects to last for around 15 to 20 years. "Today we harvest with machines," she says. "In 1939, they\'d have been harvesting with hooks and they\'d have tidied up any problems, trimming dead bits. By doing that, they\'d have got at least 30 years out of a bed. Machine harvesting has definitely shortened the life of the beds, but who wants to be out there in the depths of winter with a hook?"   Coates explains that although foreign competition and rising labour costs contributed to the decline of the wicker industry after World War Two, it was the emergence of plastic that really hit hard. The convenience and cheapness of plastic, she says, meant that the craft of the wicker basket was forgotten. But perhaps in our Attenborough-influenced post-Blue Planet II society, I suggest, wicker could replace plastic again? "Now that would be brilliant!" smiles Coates. "We\'ve really adapted since 1939 - half of our crop now goes on making artists\' drawing charcoal, but the biggest difference is that apart from furniture and baskets we are now making a lot of coffins. "If you think about a pine coffin, it would take maybe over 50 years to create the planks of wood needed and another 50 to replace them. Willow coffins make a very sustainable alternative." "On the road again, Buckland St Mary: this is the last place where the fairies were seen in Somerset," writes Winbolt. "If they followed the British in their trek westward, it seems not unlikely, because the Devon border is a short half mile away." I\'m supposed to be heading east towards Yeovil now, but am so startled by this rather whimsical entry into the guidebook by the habitually no-nonsense Winbolt that I feel forced to make a quick detour south into the folds of the Blackdown hills. I scour the sun-scorched grass in the graveyard of the beautiful Victorian church of St Mary the Virgin for signs of sprite life but find only rabbit droppings and a few sweet wrappers. Not a fairy, pixie or goblin in sight.  When I do reach "enterprising" Yeovil, Winbolt wants me to know all about leather and kid gloves. "Gloves, as for centuries past, come from Yeovil." The local football team, Yeovil Town, is still known as "The Glovers" but by the late 1980s the last of the glove manufacturers in the town had closed its doors, blaming cheap foreign imports. Yet one company, Pittards, which for most of the last two centuries was merely a leather supplier, has now brought glove-making back to the town - and it also makes other clothes, and bags. When it was founded, in 1826, Pittards worked only with local Somerset sheepskins, but now it sources its skins from Ethiopia. This shift began a long time ago; even 80 years ago, most Pittards leather was imported from Africa because it was recognised that the skins of the mountainous Cabretta or "Hairsheep" were more suitable for gloves. "Back in 1939, we would have imported raw material but now the early processing is done overseas and we do the dyeing and finishing here," says Pittards\' chief executive Reg Hankey as we watch workers on the plant floor stretching tanned leather under huge vacuum drying machines. "In \'39, we would have hung the skins on a washing line to dry for at least three days - now, with these machines, it takes five minutes!" Pittards is no longer a family business. It\'s now very much a global enterprise and 92% of the leather products it makes for the glove, shoe and automotive industries are exported. Although much of the production line has been automated, many of the finishing processes, such as staking [softening] and polishing, are still performed in exactly the same way they would have been 80 years ago.  "We haven\'t found a way of improving this method apart from with high skill," Hankey shouts to me over the deafening noise of the polishing machines, pointing out two of his workers who\'ve been polishing leather here for 37 years.  He lets me touch the cool, silky white leather that will soon be transformed into golfing gloves and explains that in September 1939, with the outbreak of war, Pittards really came into its own, developing waterproof leather for gloves worn by RAF fighter pilots. "We used to be driven by the military requirement," he smiles. "And although we do still serve the armed forces, in this day and age we are really driven by sports requirements." He shoots me a sideways glance. "With the world that we\'re in at the minute, maybe that will revert back one day?"  It\'s a depressing thought for a holidaymaker. I imagine the tourists of 1939, their brand new orange and white Penguin guides in their hand, and I wonder whether, as they excitedly motored from place to place, the threatening cloud of impending war darkened their fun? "People living in a region bounded by highlands are naturally tenacious of their soil and disinclined to migrate," asserts my guide. "Note how physical environment influences the folk of the Meare and Godney marshes - even today they seldom seem to quit their moors." At the Sheppey Inn in Godney on the Somerset Levels, the fun is just starting. Loud upbeat music pours from the door and the first of the early evening drinkers is studying the draught ciders list with the knowledgeable barmaid. The same family ran the pub for 120 years in a space that was the size of what a creative estate agent might call "an occasional bedroom or study" but in 1976 the family, rather embarrassingly for Somerset, ran out of cider and the doors slammed shut.  Then, seven years ago, Lizzie Chamberlain from London and her partner Mark decided it was time to give Godney its pub back - but on a much grander scale. Lizzie looks tired as she hands me a lime and soda - the pub can now accommodate 250 diners as well as drinkers and last night they were again at full capacity. She steels herself for tonight\'s onslaught with a strong coffee. "We do a lot of music nights," she laughs as I politely ask the bar staff to turn the music down a bit. "So people come from miles around and yet Godney is really on a road to nowhere. But it\'s turned into a lovely community pub, very much the heart of the village, with local staff and local produce… and we have an eclectic mix of people in the village now with artists and musicians, and the old villagers are living harmoniously with the new."   Lizzie introduces me to retired locals Phil Ryder and his wife, Amanda, who migrated to Godney 35 years ago and brought up three children here, including their daughter, Marigold - who is, in turn, bringing up her son here. Amanda tells me they were initially treated very much as outsiders by the villagers. But do they now feel what S E Winbolt describes as the pull of the Godney soil? "This place suits me down to the ground," grins Phil showing me his hands, which are filthy with earth. "I\'m reluctant to go on holiday or even into town. I don\'t like leaving my land and I don\'t like being indoors." Amanda makes a snide aside about Phil\'s readiness to leave his land for last orders now the pub\'s reopened and the family laughs. Amanda says she rarely leaves Godney, largely because she doesn\'t drive and there\'s only one bus a week - although she notes that she\'s often the only passenger on that bus. (Whether this is because every other villager has a car, or - as Winbolt would have it - they have a genetic disinclination to migrate, she prefers not to speculate.) Marigold, meanwhile, reflects that although she did leave to go to university, she found herself being magnetically pulled back to the marshes afterwards. "l do feel a sense of belonging," she agrees. "And whenever I go to other places I like, perhaps on holiday, nowhere else really compares. In winter it\'s bleak and can be quite depressing but it\'s beautiful and people do tend to stay… or if they do go, they tend to come back." We finish our drinks and stroll outside to sit at the coveted tables by the river for a while and we watch big, dark fish fin down deep in the clear water.  Back at Weston-super-Mare, a coach sporting a large sticker declaring that it\'s carrying the Cliff Richard Fan Club of Birmingham has just pulled up on the promenade. I wander over to a beach shack and treat myself to a rather grand-sounding lobster and crab burger and settle down with my guide book on the wide Weston sands for a moment of peace and reflection in the sunshine. That is when I\'m mugged by a vicious swarm of seagulls, one of which snatches the luxurious fish from my fingers while its fellow gang members beat their wings in my hair until I relinquish most of the chips as well.  Chewing dejectedly on the small, rather sandy piece of bun the gulls have spared me, I open the fly leaf of S E Winbolt\'s Penguin guide and read that he follows two guiding principles in life: "Aristotle\'s  energei a combined with Virgil\'s  labor improbus ." 1939 Glossary II Energeia  (Greek) - source of the modern English word "energy" but Aristotle\'s meaning is different... and not easily translated Labor improbus  (Latin) - steady work, as in the phrase "Labor omnia vicit improbus" from Virgil\'s Georgics, meaning "Steady work overcame all things" I imagine S E Winbolt sitting on the beach here in 1939, perhaps dressed in a woollen bathing suit, a knotted handkerchief on his thinning hair to protect his head from the sun - and I fantasise about slapping him.

{'title': "'I live in a church to prevent being deported'", 'author': '', 'body': 'Across the US, dozens of undocumented immigrants have taken refuge in churches to avoid deportation. For one woman in Colorado, her 14 months in sanctuary have taken a heavy toll. After midnight in the garden of Mancos United Methodist Church, Rosa Sabido can enjoy a bit of solitude. Mancos is quiet and dark at night, a one-traffic light, two-coffee shop town in southwest Colorado at the edge of where the Rocky Mountains meet desert mesas. "I spent a lot of time at night here, trying to watch the moon and the stars - my little piece of sky," says Rosa.  One evening, a family of deer came by, and baby raccoons were nesting in a tree. During the last hunting season, she heard animals separated from their packs in the hills nearby. "I heard their cry and it was like \'Oh gosh\', I cried with them, because I could truly relate to that." Rosa, 54, has not left the church grounds since 2 June 2017.  She sleeps in the church\'s community building, where a former nursery has been converted into a makeshift bedroom. She walks the dozen feet or so to the church itself to attend Sunday services.  She watches where she steps as she waters the plants in front of the church, so as to not cross the property line. For more than a year, her entire physical world has been no bigger than a quarter of a football pitch. Rosa lives here because she fears arrest by officers from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and ultimately deportation to Mexico where she was born. She is one of nearly 50 people who live in churches in the US to avoid deportation - a long standing ICE policy discourages immigration arrests in "sensitive locations" like churches and schools.  It is an extreme option and one that extracts a high and potentially lasting price. Rosa keeps busy but her time in the church is about waiting - waiting for a new Congress, waiting for a potential private bill, waiting for a different president.  And it is likely she will have a long time to wait. Even if a more sympathetic Congress is elected this autumn, she will need a series of miracles to return to her life as she lived it before. But Rosa is a believer in miracles. Her American story began 30 years ago, when she first started visiting her family in the US when still a young woman in her 20s. Both her mother and stepfather were beneficiaries of a legalisation drive in the 1980s, but Rosa was not eligible. She began spending more time in the US with them and for almost 20 years - through shifting laws and policies, bad legal advice and an attempt to represent herself in court - Rosa tried to become a lawful resident, driven by a determination not to be separated from her family in Colorado.  In 2008, she was arrested by ICE, but released with an order of supervision. Throughout the next few years, the Obama administration increased deportations to record numbers, but these were mostly border crossers. In 2011, with the help of an immigration lawyer, Rosa received her first year-long stay of removal. She was already a secretary at a Catholic parish in Cortez, and sold tamales around the area, including the Mancos farmers\' market, where she became a fixture. She continued for like that for six years, checking in with the regional ICE office, until 2017. Her immigration lawyer, Jennifer Kain-Rios, thinks stories like Rosa\'s represent how difficult it is for people to understand "what their position is in front of the law". "It\'s very unforgiving - and in order to ask for and receive a benefit, you have to have a perfect immigration history and there are very few exceptions to that." In 2017, Rosa\'s stay of removal - her seventh - was denied. ICE considers a stay of removal as a temporary benefit, a way to get the person\'s affairs in order before deportation. When asked why a one-year stay was approved six times in a row for Rosa and then denied, Carl Rusnock, a spokesman for ICE\'s central region, cited "different policies in place under a different administration". It became "very, very clear early in 2017" Kain-Rios says, that ICE\'s choices about who was being prioritised for deportation had changed under President Trump, buoyed by strong support among his voters for his election promise of an immigration crackdown. Another client of Kain-Rios had been detained at her check-in. This year, a man who lived in a nearby town with a family of US citizens and a business that employed more than a dozen people had also been detained. He was deported to Honduras. Other voices on immigration crackdown But Rosa wanted to stay in Colorado - she considered it her home, and she was one of the few people nearby who would take care of her mother, who had been in poor health. Sanctuary, Rosa says, was her best option.  "It could be either here or turn myself into ICE and be detained and held in custody and eventually be deported." ICE now considers Rosa a fugitive. She entered the country illegally and ignored multiple orders to depart before she was granted the first stay, Rusnok said in an email. "She has exhausted her appeals from the immigration and appeal courts and from ICE," he says. The night Rosa arrived at the church she hoped that things would eventually change. "I truly didn\'t think it was going to be a whole year - or more."  But she really didn\'t know what it would mean. "I was told it would change my whole life radically - I had to let go of the things I used to do. Truly enough that\'s what happened." A few months before, Mancos United Methodist Church had taken a vote among its congregants on whether the church was willing to become a sanctuary church - to take in someone at risk of deportation.  Pastor Craig Paschal says it was a natural development for their church and for Mancos. "The community itself has always been very welcoming, a very inclusive place to live, very accepting of new ideas." he says. "That\'s what\'s led us to sanctuary." But sheltering Rosa was never the original plan. The church had spoken to a nearby organisation that believed there were a handful of families in the area at risk of deportation, all of whom had lived there for at least 10 years. "They were our brothers and sisters," he says. A few people left the church over the decision, but more have joined in support of Rosa, says Paschal. "This is going to challenge us, but this is what it means to love our neighbour." A friend of Paschal told him there was a woman who lived in the next town over who believed she was about to be deported. "I knew Rosa, I knew her by name - she had actually been to our house selling tamales - and it just hit me, because it was very personal." Rosa packed up her things - her clothes, her laptop, her immigration files, her religious statues and images - and moved into the church. Paschal and a group of supporters from Mancos went to the ICE regional office in Rosa\'s place for her appointment, informing them she had taken sanctuary. "Rosa is not hiding," Kain-Rios says. On the year anniversary of Rosa\'s first night in sanctuary, the normally quiet garden outside her window was filled with dozens of people.  There was music, face painting for children and food.  On a wooden cross, Rosa and guests attached  milagros , small silver-coloured objects representing prayers and other intercessions against their burdens. Three hundred and sixty five days and counting, Rosa has something like a routine.  She checks messages on the "Rosa Belongs Here" Facebook page. She makes tamales by order and cooks when people come to attend activities like yoga and jewellery-making with her.  Every week she talks to other people in sanctuary on video conference, including three other women in Colorado. The four of them are trying to build a case they can take to Colorado legislators to help their plight. She attends the church\'s weekly Sunday service but she misses the Catholic Mass, so every week a priest comes to give her communion. It\'s one of the things she\'s lost by deciding to move into the church.  "My space, my life, my family, my home, my time, my work, my dreams, my future, you know everything," she says. "Everything is gone." She pauses. "Everything is gone." How long can she stick it out? How long can the church host her? Rosa says she\'s never considered leaving. "This is a commitment I\'ve made," she says. "I\'ve been trying all this time to become a citizen... I just tried to do the legal thing and in the end all I get was an order of deportation - I think that\'s not fair, I think that\'s wrong. I truly believe I deserve better, I\'m not a criminal, I have no criminal records, I\'ve been a productive person." The commitment to stay is "beyond my needs now", she says. "If I give up I\'m sure I\'m going to be sorry the rest of my life." Paschal says they can keep going. "I think we have the truth on our side that we need each other, we need Rosa, we need the immigrant community." But when your home is a public community space for a close-knit church, it can be hard to find privacy. "There\'s a time when you get home or when you\'re driving when it\'s your time, quiet time... it\'s just a big change," she says. Joanie Trussell is not part of the congregation, but she got involved because of Rosa\'s sanctuary. "It\'s a new thing for all of us, no one knows how to do this," she says, saying there\'s been a learning curve for the community that\'s supporting Rosa. The biggest thing, she says, is learning "how to be an ally". "How to not step in and take charge and kind of suggest on any level we know what\'s best for Rosa," she says. Rosa says it\'s nice to talk to the other people in sanctuary because very few people understand what they are going through.  Putting herself out there as a representative of the estimated 11 million undocumented people who live in the US makes her proud, and practically, gives her something to do. But it\'s draining. "I never had that much attention my whole life and people expect a lot from us," she says. "It\'s a big responsibility, but at the same time I\'m good with it. I know it\'s hard for others to stand strong. There are people who are not willing to be in public." Her faith in God gives her hope, she said in June. So she will wait. In late July, Rosa posted on Facebook that her mother had died unexpectedly during her first chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer.  She could not attend the funeral in Mexico, so she watched via video conference and looked at photos. "My beloved mom is gone," she wrote in a post showing her mother\'s casket. "The reason of my sacrifice is gone forever." Family separation, she says, is not just about young children and their parents. Despite her mother\'s death, Rosa intends to stay in sanctuary. She doesn\'t see a future for herself in Mexico.  "I need to stay here because if I give up, this is not going to work the way I want it to, which is keep raising awareness to show how unjust this. "I still want my freedom. I just want to keep fighting for justice, and I\'m not in a hurry."', 'category': 'news', 'date': '8 August 2018'}

{'title': 'The mentally ill 29-year-old helped to die by Dutch doctors', 'author': '', 'body': 'In January a young Dutch woman drank poison supplied by a doctor and lay down to die. Euthanasia is legal in Holland, so hers was a death sanctioned by the state.  But Aurelia Brouwers was not terminally ill - she was allowed to end her life on account of her psychiatric illness. "I\'m 29 years old and I\'ve chosen to be voluntarily euthanised.  I\'ve chosen this because I have a lot of mental health issues. I suffer unbearably and hopelessly. Every breath I take is torture…" A team from the Dutch TV network, RTL Nieuws spent two weeks recording Aurelia as she journeyed towards her date with death - 2pm on Friday, 26 January. On a whiteboard in her home, she crossed off the days with a heavy black marker pen. During those last weeks, she spent her time with loved ones, doing craftwork and riding her bike in Deventer, the city she adored.  She also visited the crematorium - the place she had chosen for her own funeral service. In many ways her story is uniquely Dutch. Euthanasia is against the law in most countries, but in the Netherlands it is allowed if a doctor is satisfied a patient\'s suffering is "unbearable with no prospect of improvement" and if there is "no reasonable alternative in the patient\'s situation". These criteria may be more straightforward to apply in the case of someone with a terminal diagnosis from untreatable cancer, who is in great pain. And the vast majority of the 6,585 deaths from euthanasia in Holland in 2017 were cases of people with a physical disease. But 83 people were euthanised on the grounds of psychiatric suffering.  So these were people - like Aurelia - whose conditions were not necessarily terminal.  Aurelia Brouwers\' wish to die came with a long history of mental illness. "When I was 12, I suffered from depression. And when I was first diagnosed, they told me I had Borderline Personality Disorder," she says. "Other diagnoses followed - attachment disorder, chronic depression, I\'m chronically suicidal, I have anxiety, psychoses, and I hear voices." Aurelia\'s doctors would not endorse her requests for euthanasia. So she applied to the Levenseindekliniek - the End of Life Clinic - in The Hague. This is a place of last resort for those whose applications have been rejected by their own psychiatrist or GP. The clinic oversaw 65 of the 83 deaths approved on psychiatric grounds in Holland last year, though only about 10% of psychiatric applications are approved, and the process can take years.  "The psychiatric patients we see are younger than others," says Dr Kit Vanmechelen, a psychiatrist who assesses applicants and performs euthanasia, but was not directly involved in Aurelia\'s death. "Aurelia Brouwers is an example of a very young woman. And that makes it harder to make the decision because in those cases, you take away a lot of life." During her last two weeks of life, Aurelia was often distressed and had self-harmed. "I\'m stuck in my own body, my own head, and I just want to be free," she said. "I have never been happy - I don\'t know the concept of happiness." "She was really not as stable during the day," remembers Sander Paulus, the RTL Nieuws journalist who spent much of that last fortnight with her.  "You just felt there was a lot of pressure in her head.  She didn\'t speak that well any more - except when we talked about euthanasia.  She was very clear on that."   But does clarity mean someone has the mental capacity to choose death over life? According to Dutch law, a doctor must be satisfied a patient\'s request for euthanasia is, "voluntary and well-considered". Find out more Listen to Linda Pressly\'s report,  Euthanasia - Aurelia\'s story , for Crossing Continents on BBC Radio 4, at 11:00 on Thursday 9 August Or  catch up later on the BBC iPlayer Aurelia Brouwers argued she was competent to make the decision. But could a death wish have been a symptom of her psychiatric illness? "I think you never can be 100% sure of that," says Kit Vanmechelen. "But you must have done everything to help them diminish the symptoms of their pathology.  In personality disorders a death wish isn\'t uncommon.  If that is consistent, and they\'ve had their personality disorder treatments, it\'s a death wish the same as in a cancer patient who says, \'I don\'t want to go on to the end.\'" This view is not universally held by psychiatrists in the Netherlands.  "How could I know - how could anybody know - that her death wish was not a sign of her psychiatric disease?  The fact that one can rationalise about it, does not mean it\'s not a sign of the disease," says psychiatrist Dr Frank Koerselman, one of Holland\'s most outspoken critics of euthanasia in cases of mental illness.  He argues psychiatrists should never collude with clients who claim they want to die.  "It is possible not to be contaminated by their lack of hope.  These patients lost hope, but you can stay beside them and give them hope.  And you can let them know that you will never give up on them," he says. Aurelia Brouwers\' death provoked huge debate in the Netherlands, and made headlines around the world. No-one has suggested it was illegal, although critics have asked whether it was the kind of case for which the 2002 legislation allowing euthanasia was enacted.  Opinions divide on whether there was an acceptable alternative. For example Kit Vanmechelen argues that when people apply for euthanasia on psychiatric grounds, in some cases they will kill themselves if they don\'t get it. In her view, they should be regarded as people with terminal illnesses. "I\'ve treated patients that I knew were going to commit suicide," she says. "I knew. They told me, I felt it, and I thought, \'I can\'t help you.\' So to have euthanasia as an alternative makes me very grateful we have a law. The ones I know will commit suicide are terminal in my opinion.  And I don\'t want to abandon my patients who are not able to go on with their lives. That makes me willing to perform euthanasia." "I simply disagree," says Frank Koerselman. "My whole career I worked with suicidal patients - none of them was terminal.  Of course I had patients who committed suicide, but as a matter of fact these were always cases when you didn\'t expect it." In RTL\'s film, Aurelia Brouwers talks about attempts to end her own life.  "I think I tried about 20 times. I was critical a few times, but I often got to hear that my heart and lungs were so healthy.  The doctors said, \'It\'s a miracle, she made it.\'" And surviving a suicide attempt is not unusual - people do it every day.  Monique Arend, like Aurelia Brouwers, was diagnosed with psychiatric illness including Borderline Personality Disorder.  People with this condition may self-harm, have intense feelings of anger, find it hard to sustain relationships, and be very unstable. Monique made many attempts to kill herself. "It happened everywhere - at home, in the forest... But I\'m very grateful I\'m still alive today," she says. Monique is a survivor of violent sexual abuse, and terrifying psychiatric episodes.  She thought long and hard about euthanasia. "I thought I was a big problem for everyone, and I just didn\'t want to be that burden, and the pain became unbearable.  So I requested the forms for euthanasia, and filled them in. But I never filed them."  Monique did not file those papers because she found help.  In the early days of her illness, a counsellor had advised her not to talk about the abuse - this is when she began to self-harm. But then she found a new therapist who specialised in trauma.  Where to get help BBC Action Line  -  information and support  "She told me I\'m not crazy, but I\'m traumatised - that\'s a big difference.  We worked very hard together - it was very painful.  But we went through it, and since then I\'ve been on a recovery trip," Monique says.     She has written a book about her experiences, and has some advice for people struggling with suicidal thoughts or considering euthanasia in Holland.  "It\'s heavy, hard and tough," she says. "But keep a candle burning.  Look for people who can support you. You guys are so powerful because you\'ve been through so much - there\'s still room for you on this planet." The discomfort around euthanasia for psychiatric patients is partly to do with a concern that all options may not have been explored. At the End of Life Clinic in The Hague more than half of those who come seeking euthanasia on psychiatric grounds are turned away because they have not tried all available treatments. "I had a patient who had a lot of treatments, and was convinced nothing more could help him.  But he had never been in a clinic to help with abuse of prescription medicine and alcohol," says Kit Vanmechelen. "So I said to him, \'For half a year you must make a real effort to lessen your use of those, and if then you still have a death wish, well, come back and we\'ll talk.\'" But Vanmechelen believes that after a patient has undergone multiple treatments for the same diagnosis, it is reasonable to say, enough is enough. This was what Aurelia Brouwers argued too. She had been treated for her illness - she had therapy and took medication - but we do not know the details. "We need to get rid of the taboo that you should always remain in treatment, until the bitter end," she said. "For people like me there isn\'t always a solution - you can\'t keep taking medicine, you can\'t pray indefinitely… At some point you just have to stop." But people can and do live for decades with psychiatric disorders. "They\'re not treatable like an infection, they\'re like diabetes - you\'ve got the disease, you will have it the rest of your life, but we, as doctors, are going to make it possible for you to live with it," argues Frank Koerselman.  "Like people with diabetes, psychiatric patients are also treated for years, but this is not an argument to stop treatment. "It\'s very well known that after the age of 40 things might go much better for people with Borderline Personality Disorder - their symptoms might become much milder." Aurelia Brouwers died more than a decade before she reached 40. On her last full day on Earth she was visited by her favourite singer, Marco Borsato.  That night, she had dinner with her friends - there was laughter, and a toast. On the morning of 26 January she posted for the final time on social media: "I\'m getting ready for my trip now. Thank you so much for everything.  I\'m no longer available from now on." Aurelia Brouwers\' loved ones assembled in her bedroom.  Two medics were in attendance.    "I\'m sure that the moment I give the poison - because that\'s what you do, you give poison - I\'m very sure that is the only thing the patient wants at that moment and has wanted for a long period, otherwise I wouldn\'t be able to do it," says Kit Vanmechelen.  "In the first meeting with a patient, I tell them, this will be the last question I ask you: \'Are you sure you want this? And if there is a little doubt, we will stop, come back, and talk about it again.\'" And has that ever happened to her? "No. It doesn\'t happen." In Aurelia\'s case, doctors did not administer the drugs that killed her - she drank the medication herself.  In the RTL Nieuws documentary, she has a last conversation with Sander Paulus, as she holds the small, sealed medicine bottle.  "This is the drink," she says. "I know it tastes bitter, so I\'m just going to drink it down. And then I\'m going to sleep." Sander Paulus asks her if she has any doubts.  "No doubts," Aurelia says. "I\'m ready - ready to go on a journey." "I hope you find what you\'re looking for," he says.  "I definitely will," is Aurelia\'s reply. Aurelia Brouwers turns her back on Sander Paulus, and climbs the stairs.  It is just after 2pm on Friday, 26 January, 2018.

{'title': "Will Trump's tariffs stop Chinese espionage?", 'author': '', 'body': 'Dan McGahn says it was a case of attempted murder. The victim was his business American Superconductor (AMSC), and the perpetrator was a Chinese company called Sinovel Windpower. The two firms had been partners, but Sinovel bribed an insider to steal AMSC\'s key wind turbine technology. As a result Massachusetts-based AMSC saw its sales collapse, its market value plummet by $1bn (£770m), and it had to lay off hundreds of employees. "It was attempted corporate homicide," says Mr McGahn. This act of industrial espionage was uncovered back in 2011, and after a seven-year legal fight,  a US judge last month fined Sinovel just $1.5m, the maximum currently possible. While Sinovel is also continuing to pay AMSC an agreed settlement of $57.5m, the US firm is getting back just a fraction of the losses it endured. The case of AMSC is perhaps exactly what President Trump has in mind when he rages against Chinese industrial espionage. At the start of last month the US government introduced tariffs on $34bn worth of Chinese exports, saying they were a result of China\'s "unfair trade practices", which included stealing US intellectual property. A few days later the White House warned that the tariffs could be extended to $200bn worth of Chinese products. Then three weeks ago  Trump threatened to put tariffs on all $500bn worth of annual Chinese exports to the US. Will such a blanket tactic get Chinese firms to stop carrying out acts of industrial espionage, or should the US switch to a more targeted approach? Firstly though, exactly how did Sinovel bribe an AMSC worker? Global Trade More from the BBC\'s series taking an international perspective on trade: When AMSC\'s wind power division first went into partnership with Sinovel back in 2007, it was applauded for its global ambition and business nous at a time when countries around the world were rushing to build more and more wind farms. AMSC knew that tying up with a Chinese firm came with risks, so it used all kinds of strategies to limit this, such as encrypting the software codes or "brains" that operated its turbines,  Yet without warning, in 2011 Sinovel said it didn\'t need any more shipments of the turbine technology it had been buying from AMSC. Despite the American firm\'s best efforts to defend its secrets, Sinovel had bribed an AMSC employee, a Serbian national employed at its office in Austria, to hand over the key software. The man in question - Dejan Karabasevic - had been offered money, a job, an apartment, a whole new life in China. He  was found guilty by a court in Austria in 2011 . AMSC\'s case is far from unique, and US firms in sectors from metals to microchips, and telecoms and transport have complained about Chinese rivals stealing their technology. Even US biscuit stable Oreo cookies faced a Chinese copycat. The situation is said to be so bad that the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, an independent US body including representatives from the public and private sectors, estimates  that $600bn worth of US intellectual property is stolen every year , led by China. Mr McGahn points out that the rules on foreign investment in China - such as the need to partner with a Chinese company - make it difficult for even the most careful overseas companies to protect their trade secrets. He says the whole system for investing in China is set up for local firms to win. Just a few months into Mr Trump\'s presidency, experts convened at the White House - technical specialists, policy wonks, cabinet members and academics - to discuss how to tackle the problem. Following a seven-month investigation a White House report accused Beijing of "state-led, market-distorting forced technology transfers". The Chinese government always says it is doing its best to prevent infringement of intellectual property, and in 2015 it pledged to clean up those firms not playing by the rules. But Derek Scissors, China expert at the American Enterprise Institute think tank, says China has long been a "technology leech". In his view Beijing stands squarely behind the Chinese firms committing the thefts. "The idea that these firms are engaging in mass industrial espionage without the blessing of the Chinese government is not the slightest bit believable," says Mr Scissors, who was one of the experts who advised the White House on the issue. "The Chinese monitor everything." Other observers suggest that it is a more subtle process. Mara Hvistendahl, a fellow of the New America think tank and author of a forthcoming book on industrial espionage, says that Beijing simply "looks the other way when companies steal in order to deliver [technological breakthroughs]". Both agree though that prosecuting spies who are caught red-handed is no longer enough. It is the equivalent of arresting drug-mules, rather than the masterminds, when tackling the illegal drug trade, Ms Hvistendahl says.   Moreover, espionage is increasingly taking place in cyberspace, allowing perpetrators to remain thousands of miles beyond the reach of law enforcers. Skilful hackers may not even leave a trace of their break in. The other obstacle to successful legal prosecutions is a lack of plaintiffs willing to face the exposure, points out Professor Mark Button, director of the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies at Portsmouth University in the UK. "Imagine a big pharma company has a wonder drug; if that information is lost to a competitor that can have big financial implications," he says. "It can be embarrassing and it can have implications for the share price." For that reason Prof Button speculates that the lack of high profile cases in Europe in recent years, probably disguises a hidden iceberg of incidents below the surface. The only really effective counterespionage strategy may be better defence at the company-level, he suggests. But Prof Button has some sympathy with Mr Trump\'s massive tariffs approach in confronting China over their practices, in precipitating "a showdown" over the problem. Derek Scissors is much more sceptical: "The solution we\'ve come up with is completely misguided." He says blanket tariffs fail to distinguish between firms that have benefited from espionage and those that have not. "You have to punish the guilty or you don\'t get a change of behaviour," he says. Instead he\'d like to see sanctions targeted against specific firms - ones that are clearly reproducing American technology that they haven\'t developed themselves. He believes that would be more effective than "the quick fix" chosen by the administration. But targeting and punishing individual companies is a tough road to travel as AMSC\'s experience shows. While AMSC continues to rebuild its business, Sinovel is continuing to thrive.', 'category': 'news', 'date': '9 August 2018'}

{'title': 'Remembering Khensani Maseko who fought South African campus rape', 'author': '', 'body': 'The death of a law student and anti-rape activist in South Africa has brought the simmering issue of campus rape back to the forefront.  Khensani Maseko, 23, took her own life last week after writing a post on Instagram: "No-one deserves to be raped!"  Days earlier the third year student had reported to the authorities at Rhodes University in Grahamstown that she was allegedly raped by a fellow student in May. "The university immediately made contact with her family [after the alleged rape was reported] and they travelled the next day from Johannesburg to Grahamstown for a meeting where they elected to take Khensani home for a while," Rhodes University said in a statement.  The institution said a decision to suspend the alleged perpetrator was made on Monday, three days after Ms Maseko died. \'She stood up for women\' Her passing left students reeling with grief and anger. The school suspended academic activities on campus for two days after student representatives called for a "campus shutdown" to honour her. "The world has lost a jewel. It lost someone who really stood up for women," her friend Florence Bagonza, who now lives in Uganda, told the BBC. "There is something about Khensani that let her stand out. She was confident and when she spoke you could feel her power," she said, adding that they had met in 2016 at a student-organised event called "Women of Influence". Others agreed she was an active member of student body, juggling various roles as she completed her law degree. Content is not available In 2016, she was elected into the university\'s Student Representative Council (SRF), was a member of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EEF) party student group and last year won "Miss Varsity Shield", a pageant that helps support university rugby.   Close friend Eric Ofei, a former student who now works at Rhodes University, said he also came to know Ms Maseko in 2016 when he mentored her as she ran to become councillor with the SRF. "She was far from quiet" and could not "be ignored", he said while waiting to get on a plane to Johannesburg, where he will be attending her funeral on Thursday.  We’re deeply saddened by the passing of our Miss Varsity Shield 2017, Khensani Maseko. Our deepest condolences go to Khensani’s family and friends. We lost a great soul.  pic.twitter.com/XxbnHRFvYg End of Twitter post  by @varsityshield Siya Nyulu, who says she cried for an hour after hearing of Ms Maseko\'s death, says the law student "fought against [alleged] rape culture on campus".  According to the 22-year-old student, Ms Maseko was a supporter of the 2016 student protests over the issue.  Allegations against Rhodes University\'s campus rape problem began with a poster campaign called "\'Chapter 212\' to get students talking about rape culture and how to dismantle it", Ms Nyulu told the BBC. The poster campaign alleged the processes to report rape were inaccessible and there was a lack of staff to process the claims. Because when we report sexual assault, this is what we\'re told  #Chapter212   pic.twitter.com/3LfBKR3qY9 End of Twitter post  by @NalediMashishi "Members of the movement state that management is accountable for perpetuating rape culture at Rhodes, and these discriminatory and victim-shaming policies must change," Rhodes\' student news publication Activate wrote at the time. Days after, a list of 11 alleged campus rapists was leaked on social media,  culminating in students marches and protests that were broken up by police . According to South African law, suspects in sex crimes can only be named after they have appeared in court and pleaded. Read more But students at the university who say they have been victims of rape complain that no action was taken when they reported the assaults. The protesting students also called for changes in the university\'s rape policy, demanded the immediate suspension of those listed,  and for the burden of proof removed from victims .  The hashtag #RUReferencelist began trending in South Africa as the situation escalated when students and sympathetic staff members reportedly clashed with the police who were firing rubber bullets. The anti-rape protests shut down the university\'s campus for a week. By the end of the week the university had set up a team to investigate the issue and address the students\' demands.  The investigation team came up with around 90 recommendations, but Ms Nyulu said "those recommendations have not been met".  "The university is failing to accept this is the current the issue," she said. "Khensani died for something she was protesting against. How can you say the university has changed when someone has died?"  \'Educating men\' The university\'s vice-chancellor, Sizwe Mabizela, conceded there was a problem on campus during a memorial service for Ms Maseko on Tuesday.  "We always tell young women how they should conduct themselves, yet we fail to tell young men they have no right to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person," he said, according to the  South African Independent Online .  "We hope this tragic incident will allow the university an opportunity to reflect and engage, even deeper, on how we must pull together as a university and society to eliminate the scourge of gender-based violence." Both Ms Nyulu and Ms Bagonza said the protests in 2016 were distressing as they are victims of rape.  Ms Bagonza said that while universities are a place for learning, they should acknowledge the wider context of gender-based violence in South Africa and provide "enough resources to help students suffering from mental health issues and rape," she says.  South Africa has one of the highest rape statistics in world - last year there were nearly 4,000 cases reported to the South African police. According to Africa Check, the femicide rate in South Africa is five times higher than the global rate.  The issue is so pernicious that thousands of women demonstrated across the country last week against the increase in gender-based violence.  Meanwhile, students from Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth staged a protest on Monday following an alleged rape last week. "This is not just about the university, this is something that our society has failed to acknowledge," Ms Bagonza said.

{'title': 'How super-rich tourism may help the planet', 'author': '', 'body': 'On a remote tropical island in the Indian Ocean, a man in a woman\'s wig has been hiding in a bush for hours. Armed with an air rifle, he plans to kill the island\'s last three surviving specimens of an exotic bird. This, unlikely as it might appear, is the current front line in a conservation revolution. "Normally, you see environment and development at each other\'s necks," the Seychelles tourism minister, Didier Dogley tells me. "Here we have pioneered an approach that turns it the other way round." The Seychelles model, as Mr Dogley calls it, claims tourist development doesn\'t damage the environment, it positively improves it.  It sounds a little far-fetched. The demands of the global traveller can place a heavy footprint on the perfect white sands of a fragile eco-system like the Seychelles. For even the most responsible tour operator, it is usually a question of mitigating the damage.   The seeds of the idea washed up on a number of  Seychelles islands in the 1990s, notably North Island, bought by the ecotourism pioneers Wilderness Safaris in 1997.   The company had strong green credentials having established safaris across southern Africa that diverted tourist revenues to help save dozens of critically endangered species and fund conservation projects.  Now their attention had shifted to one granite dot in the island group.  North Island was a mess. It had been abandoned as a coconut plantation. Rats had killed off the wedge-tailed shearwater and the white-tailed tropicbird, seabirds that had nested there in vast numbers.   Once the home to thousands of giant tortoises, now just three remained. Invasive flora and fauna had crowded out the natives, including rare endemic species, found only in Seychelles.   Wilderness decided to restore the island to its former natural glory and get super-rich tourists to pay for it. It was an audacious plan. Eleven exclusive luxury villas, each costing guests several thousand euros a night, were hidden among the Takamaka trees and coconut palms along the white sand beaches.  The hope was that the world\'s wealthiest would be wooed by a unique feel-good factor: fabulous luxury, total privacy and the quiet satisfaction of doing something positive for the planet.   Rumour has it that the Clooneys have been guests at least once. The Beckhams are said to have stayed. We do know the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent their honeymoon on North Island.   "Instead of building a hotel and then beautifying the place with exotic things, the hoteliers and investors in small islands like North Island have twisted the whole thing around," Mr Dogley says.   "They remove the exotics and bring in the endemics and natives, making that the attraction for the tourists that stay on the island. I think this is an incredible model." The Seychelles The tourism ministry is now promoting a "one island, one hotel" policy. A hotel business can apply for exclusive access to a small corner of an island otherwise designated a Seychelles nature reserve. The hotel must then spend part of its turnover on restoring and improving the island\'s ecology.   "Something on this island is mystical. At a certain time it hits you," says Andre Borg, a veteran of global hotel chains who does not strike you as an eco-warrior.   "I was career-driven. Then I arrived as general manager at Hilton Labriz on Silhouette here in Seychelles and I thought, how am I going to survive on this island?" Mr Borg says he found himself listening to the voice of the island. And the message, he reckons, was clear. "You have to follow what it says. The future is sustainability." He ordered the end of plastic water bottles at his hotel, following the lead of the eco-hotel on North Island. Rather than pay £4 a time, guests now fill reusable bottles for free. Hotel chains operating in Seychelles accept they now compete on how green they are, funding coral nurseries and environmental rangers.  "There are just 50 sheath-tailed bats in the world," Mr Borg says. "Twenty-three of them live in a cave on this island. I have never seen them, but we have to protect them." Protecting and enhancing the environment will require commitment and there are inevitable questions as to what happens when the warm green rhetoric of a hotel\'s marketing department no longer satisfies the cool bottom-line demands of the finance department. The experience of North Island is a reminder that making a tangible difference can take decades. In the 1990s, the first priority was to de-rat the island, but it took two attempts and eight years before the owners could announce in 2005 that North Island was, finally, rat free. Strict controls still exist to stop a reinvasion. There is no jetty: every box and case coming ashore is carried by hand up the beach and into a series of sealed rooms where each is checked individually.  Without rats, and also now without the alien barn owls and cats foolishly introduced by plantation owners to control the rats, native birds are returning.  Endemic species are being re-introduced, part of what is called the Noah\'s Ark project. The Seychelles white-eye, a charming and curious little bird, remains one of the rarest in the world. After North Island was declared rat free, 25 were brought from one of the few remaining colonies. Last year the island population had reached at least 140 with signs numbers are still rising fast.  The white-eye\'s success is not just down to de-ratting. It is also about dealing with one of the most invasive and aggressive birds on the planet. The Indian myna has been renamed the common myna because it has spread far beyond its indigenous territory, killing and displacing native birds as it goes. Introduced to the Seychelles by pirates and traders, who admired its parrot-like ability to mimic speech, it has become such a menace that an international fight back has begun.   A publicity-shy former British undercover policeman is among the myna eradicators travelling the world helping people outwit the birds. "He used traps and decoys initially, but the birds are smart," North Island conservation manager Tarryn Havemann explains.   "We gradually got the numbers down from around 700 to just three, but we cannot eradicate the final few. Sometimes they come to my window just to mock me!" And that is why a man has been hiding in a bush wearing a woman\'s wig. Experts advise that myna birds can recognise faces, clothing and even hairstyles, so better to track them in disguise.  There is urgency here. Only when the last three have been killed will North Island be allowed to reintroduce other endemic birds, including the incredibly rare Seychelles magpie robin.  Tropicbirds and shearwaters are breeding on the island once more. Green turtle nest numbers have increased six-fold in 20 years. Around a hundred giant tortoises now plod their way amiably around the plateau. More than 30% of the land has undergone some rehabilitation, but it could take 50 years simply to remove the rampant coconut palms from the island. "Will conservation still be sexy then?" Mrs Havemann asks. One must hope. Government, businesses and environmentalists all seem to be singing the same tune for now, an infectious melody that can be heard in the chirruping of the white-eye, the rustling leaves of the Takamaka tree and the crash of the Indian Ocean on the fragile coral reefs of Seychelles.   Once you have heard it, it is a song you struggle to get out of your head.', 'category': 'news', 'date': '9 August 2018'}

{'title': 'New South Wales drought now affects entire state', 'author': '', 'body': 'Australia\'s most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), is now entirely in drought, officials have confirmed. A dry winter has intensified what has been called the worst drought in living memory in parts of eastern Australia. NSW produces about a quarter of Australia\'s agricultural output. It was officially listed as "100% in drought" on Wednesday. The state and federal governments have provided A$576m (£330m; $430m) in emergency relief funding. "There isn\'t a person in the state that isn\'t hoping to see some rain for our farmers and regional communities," said NSW Minister for Primary Industries Niall Blair. How is the drought being felt?  Farmers have told harrowing stories of failing crops, severe water shortages and being unable to feed livestock.  Some have spent up to A$10,000 per truckload of hay just to feed their animals, according to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. "It\'s like you are in jail every day," Queensland farmer Ashley Gamble  told the Nine Network . "You turn up here because you\'ve got to turn up. It\'s just depressing." Stock agent Simon Bourke  told the ABC : "We\'re selling livestock we don\'t want to sell… down the track there\'s really not going to be too many cattle or sheep left." Cattle farmer David Graham said he was resigned to waiting for rain, telling the BBC: "In our community you just support each other through the tough times." Suicide rates in rural regions are on average about 40% higher than in urban areas, mental health group Sane Australia has said. What has caused the drought? Southern Australia has just experienced its second-driest autumn on record, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, with rainfall 57mm (2.24in) below average. Less than 10mm of rain was then recorded in parts of NSW in July, and drier than normal conditions are forecast in coming months. On Wednesday, officials said 23% of NSW was classified as being in "intense drought", with the remainder in drought or drought-affected. But the problem is not confined to NSW - more than half of neighbouring Queensland is in drought. Parts of Victoria and South Australia are also experiencing dry conditions. On Sunday, Prime Minister  Malcolm Turnbull warned that the country had become a "land of drought" . Is this because of climate change? The weather in Australia naturally varies a lot year-on-year, and droughts are caused by many different, complex factors. Scientists are reluctant to blame any single event on rising emissions. However, the Australian government says some of the aspects that affect drought, such as high atmospheric pressure,  could be becoming more likely because of human-induced climate change.  While touring some of the worst-hit areas in June, PM Turnbull said: "I don\'t know many people in rural New South Wales that... don\'t think the climate is getting drier and rainfall is becoming more volatile." What are authorities doing? Farmers are already eligible for annual relief payments of up to A$16,000 each. Earlier this week, Mr Turnbull announced additional payments of up to A$12,000. The prime minister said that although drought was considered "part of the Australian climate", farmers needed help. "What we have to do is make sure we [the government] back them when the times get as tough as they are now," he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation earlier this week. However, some have criticised the measure as "too little, too late" and said the payments process is too onerous. Almost 20,000 eligible people are yet to apply for the grant. Is this Australia\'s worst drought? No, the so-called millennium drought of 1997-2005 is often cited as the most devastating - it ravaged almost 50% of Australia\'s agricultural land. That event coincided with two El Nino systems, powerful weather phenomena that are often associated with droughts in Australia. Earlier this year, meteorologists rated Australia as having a 50% chance of experiencing an El Nino in its spring beginning in September. Are you a farmer in New South Wales?

{'title': "A charity made up an 'ivory brand', and not everyone is happy", 'author': '', 'body': 'It was a luxury brand that sounded too controversial to be true - and it was.  "Vintage" retailer Ivory Lane  attracted public ire when it went online in Singapore this week , touting modern designer jewellery and accessories made from ivory.  "Ivory is a secret desire for most girls," said its ad campaign.  But the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has now revealed it was all a publicity campaign  to promote awareness of the global trade in elephant ivory. "The brand may be fictional but the issues highlighted are real. This was just the start," WWF-Singapore CEO Elaine Tan told the BBC.   "We are calling for clear and robust laws that will not allow the trade of ivory or any illegal wildlife products in Singapore."  Following the big reveal, many applauded the WWF\'s novel approach in tackling the issue of elephant ivory. But did the conservation body go too far in selling its cause?  Ivory, mainly from elephant tusks, has been traded for hundreds of years. But a growing outcry against the trade kicked off bans in Asia, its biggest market.  So it was no surprise that the launch of Ivory Lane sparked an immediate uproar in Singapore, where ivory from elephants killed before 1990 can legally be sold.  Highly-polished marketing videos, professionally-worded ads combined with expensive statement pieces (inspired by the "luxury of nature and heritage") built a thoroughly believable brand narrative and drew the fury of animal lovers and netizens alike on Facebook.  Many Singaporeans - and  media outlets  - were fooled, buying into the outrage and taking to Facebook to express their anger at the brand and its mistreatment of elephants.   Indulge in nature\'s ultimate luxury - ivory. Follow us on a journey as we unveil our latest collection. http://bit.ly/ivorylanelaunch #ivorylanesg End of Facebook post  by Ivory Lane Singapore "Ivory is a secret desire for most girls - said no one with a heart ever," wrote Christine Neo in response to "founder" Ivy Chung\'s words.  "Why would you even assume ivory is something many Singaporeans would want to buy?"  Hundreds of strongly-worded  Facebook reviews  also followed swiftly. But the fictional Ms Chung had her defence ready: "We understand the concerns and would like to assure that the ivory we use is completely legal in Singapore." Highlighting a very telling loophole, she continued: "The import and export of elephant ivory has been banned internationally since 1990. Ivory Lane does not import any new ivory into Singapore and all our ivory products are made of vintage ivory, before 1990."  Disgusting and evil. Can not believe people are selling ivory openly in 2018. Sinngapore needs to look into its business ethics. End of Facebook post  by Raffael The outcry only intensified and rattled on for days, as more and more ads emerged.  On Tuesday, the WWF revealed it was "a fictitious brand that was created by WWF-Singapore to highlight the shortcomings of wildlife laws in Singapore".  It cited a recent investigation which found more than 40 shops in Singapore selling ivory products. Thank you for lending your voice. \n\nDisclaimer: Ivory Lane is a fictitious brand that was created by WWF-Singapore to... End of Facebook post 2 by Ivory Lane Singapore One Facebook user, Nicolette Dode Tan, applauded the approach. "It was a great marketing campaign and wouldn\'t have worked this well if it didn\'t tap into the reality of living in Singapore.  "The materialism, the lack of transparency in our supply chains, technical legalities as well as abhorrent practices like consuming sharks fin just because it\'s a traditional thing," she said.  "Riling people up by creating a fake brand and drawing attention? That worked wonderfully," added Facebook user Kyaw Tay Zar. "The usual media campaigns don\'t bring much deserved attention as it should. People usually glaze over such issues." But to Singaporeans like Alvin Ho and Joshua Kho, who bought into the campaign\'s narrative, it came across as being "irresponsible fake news".  "A silly way of drawing attention to an issue," wrote Mr Ho.  More about the global ivory trade:  Mr Kho said: "Regardless of intention, using deliberate misinformation is disrespectful and childish. You\'ve lost my trust, WWF. This was \'Fake News\' for me."  Addressing the unhappiness online, WWF\'s Ms Tan told the BBC: "The overwhelming and strong response towards Ivory Lane made it very clear that people in Singapore have a zero tolerance stance towards the illegal wildlife trade." "We saw the need to take such an approach as Singapore is a significant player in the illegal wildlife trade, both as a transhipment hub and demand market," she said.  "People had to be aware and care about our role in illegal wildlife trade, in order to drive change." ', 'category': 'news', 'date': '8 August 2018'}

{'title': 'Stanford sex attack: Brock Turner loses assault appeal', 'author': '', 'body': 'An appeals court has rejected an attempt by former US college student Brock Turner to have his sexual assault and attempted rape felonies overturned. His case garnered national attention in 2016 after the former star swimmer was sentenced to just six months in jail. A three-judge panel in a San Jose, California court ruled Wednesday that arguments put forward by Turner\'s lawyer for a new trial lacked merit. The ruling means the 22-year-old will remain on the sex-offenders register. Turner was originally arrested in 2015 after two students witnessed him assaulting an unconscious woman outside a Stanford University fraternity house party. In 2016 a jury found him guilty him of three charges: sexually assaulting an intoxicated victim, sexually assaulting an unconscious victim and attempting to rape her. Although prosecutors had sought a six-year term for his crimes, Turner was sentenced to six months and released after serving three.  The case judge, Aaron Persky, was widely criticised for leniency and removed from office by voters earlier this year after a recall campaign. In July\'s Turner\'s lawyer Eric Multhaup argued gaps in the prosecution\'s case meant jurors had used "speculation" and "filled in the blanks" to reach their guilty verdicts. He told the court justices there was no evidence to prove at what point the woman lost consciousness, and argued his client did not intend to the rape because he was found fully clothed, instead describing Turner\'s actions as "outercourse". But the appeal court on Wednesday said the trial was fair and upheld his convictions.  Turner could still petition the state\'s supreme court to consider an appeal.  His case gained notoriety after  a moving impact statement by the victim was shared widely online . It sparked a national debate about sexual assault and whether white men from wealthy backgrounds were treated more favourably by the US justice system. Outrage at the sentencing was compounded by a letter from Turner\'s father  suggesting his son\'s life stood to be "altered forever" and argued he should not be jailed for "20 minutes of action".

{'title': "Ditching tight pants 'improves sperm count'", 'author': '', 'body': 'Wearing looser underpants could be a simple way for men to improve their sperm count and the hormones that control it, a US study suggests. In a study of 656 men, by researchers at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, in the US, boxer short wearers had a 25% higher sperm concentration than men in tight-fitting underwear. Cooler temperatures around the testicles could be the reason. Experts say this simple lifestyle change could improve men\'s fertility. \'Brain boosts sperm production\' Sperm production is known to be sensitive to temperatures above 34C (92F), which is why the testicles hang down away from the body. Some styles of underpants, such as jockey shorts or briefs, bring the scrotum nearer to the body, causing the testicles to warm up, while others, such as boxer shorts, are looser and cooler.  In the largest study of its kind to date, the researchers found men attending a fertility clinic with looser-fitting boxer shorts had higher sperm concentration, a 17% higher total sperm count and 33% more swimming sperm than men with tighter-fitting underwear.  However, the sperm shape wasn\'t affected and neither was the DNA quality.  Researchers, who took into account other factors that can affect sperm, including age, body mass index (BMI) and habits such as smoking and hot tub use, speculate that the higher heat inside pants is the root of the problem. The  study, published in the journal Human Reproduction,  also found that a hormone from the brain that tells the testicle to make sperm, called follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), was 14% lower in wearers of looser underwear.  The findings suggest that this hormone kicks into gear when it needs to compensate for increasing scrotal temperatures and decreasing sperm counts in tight underwear. Prof Allan Pacey, professor of andrology, from the University of Sheffield, who was not involved in the study, said the different levels of FSH among men with different types of underwear "suggests that the tight-pant wearers have evidence of testicular damage". \'Reproduction is a team sport\' The study is about sperm quantity and quality, however, and not fertility itself.  Regardless of the types of underpants worn, sperm counts were in the normal range.  But Prof Pacey told the BBC: "Potentially switching from tight to loose might help some men who are on the lower edge of sperm production. "It shows that tight pants have an effect and shows there is a relatively cheap and easy thing that men can attempt to do to try and improve their situation." The paper\'s author, Dr Jorge Chaverro, told the BBC: "It takes about three months for an entire population of sperm to change, so plan in advance. "Infertility is most certainly not just a female problem. Reproduction is a team sport. You need both people to make a baby.  "I think we still have a lot to learn about men\'s contribution to fertility."\u2003', 'category': 'news', 'date': '9 August 2018'}

During their ordeal, it emerged that the boys and their coach were among around 480,000 stateless people living in the south-east Asian country. It prompted calls to fast-track their citizenship applications. The four were part of a 13-strong team, known as the Wild Boars, who became trapped deep in a cave on 23 June. They were found by two British divers nine days later, but it took another six days to rescue the first team members. Coach Ekapol Chantawong, who was widely praised for keeping the boys safe after rain flooded the cave system, was rescued on the 18th day, along with the final three boys. Mr Chantawong and three of the youngsters - who were all reportedly born in Thailand - were handed their citizenship cards in a ceremony on Wednesday. Somsak Kanakam, chief officer of Mae Sai district in Chiang Rai, said they had "all the qualifications". However, he told news agency AFP it had nothing to do with the cave incident.

{'title': 'New York votes to cap Uber and Lyft services', 'author': '', 'body': 'New York has become the first major US city to approve a cap on ride-hail car licences and set minimum pay conditions for drivers.  The bill will impact popular app-based services like Uber and Lyft, who have both spoken out against it. Yellow cab drivers and anti-congestion campaigners have pushed for regulation after the number of app-based cars soared in recent years.  About 80,000 now operate throughout the city, versus just 13,500 yellow cabs. Taxi drivers demonstrated in support of the bill outside the headquarters of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) this week, holding signs with the names and faces of six taxi drivers who had taken their lives since December. Campaign and union groups directly linked the financial pressures caused by the growth of ride-hail car services to the driver suicides. The bill passed on Wednesday approves a year-long moratorium on new ride-hail vehicle licences for 12 months, with the exception of wheelchair accessible cars.  It also gives the TLC the power to regulate minimum rates of fares, minimum pay for drivers and create a new rulebook for app companies.  The legislation was supported by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said it would help "stop the influx of cars" causing congestion in the city. However, ride-hail services have criticised the bill and argued it will hurt consumers. Uber said in a statement: "The city\'s 12-month pause on new vehicle licenses will threaten one of the few reliable transportation options while doing nothing to fix the subways or ease congestion." Lyft said the move would "bring New Yorkers back to an era of struggling to get a ride, particularly for communities of colour and in the outer boroughs." New York is the biggest US market for app Uber.   A study last month estimated that app-based drivers now complete over 17 million trips a month in New York . The study, commissioned for the TLC, recommended a minimum hourly wage for drivers of $17.22 per hour - and found that 85% of app-based drivers currently net below that amount. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance celebrated the vote, describing it on its website as a historic victory for its 18,000-member strong union. ', 'category': 'news', 'date': '9 August 2018'}

{'title': 'Skripal attack: US to sanction Russia over Novichok use', 'author': '', 'body': 'The US has said it will impose fresh sanctions on Russia after determining it used nerve agent against a former Russian double agent living in the UK. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left seriously ill after being poisoned with Novichok in Salisbury in March, though they have now recovered. A UK investigation blamed Russia for the attack, but the Kremlin has strongly denied any involvement. Russia has criticised the new sanctions as "draconian". In a statement released on Wednesday, the US state department confirmed it was implementing measures against Russia over the incident. Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said it had been determined that the country "has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law, or has used lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals". The British government has welcomed the move. "The strong international response to the use of a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury sends an unequivocal message to Russia that its provocative, reckless behaviour will not go unchallenged," a UK foreign office statement said. The Russian embassy in the US hit back on Thursday morning, criticising what it called "far-fetched accusations" from the US that Russia was behind the attack. Russia had become "accustomed to not hearing any facts or evidence", it said, adding: "We continue to strongly stand for an open and transparent investigation of the crime committed in Salisbury." What are the sanctions? The new sanctions will take effect on or around 22 August, and relate to the exports of sensitive electronic components and other technologies.  The state department said "more draconian" sanctions will follow within 90 days if Russia fails to give reliable assurances it will no longer use chemical weapons and allow on-site inspections by the United Nations. An official said it was only the third time that the US had determined a country had used chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals. Previous occasions were against Syria and against North Korea for the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of leader Kim Jong-un, who died when highly toxic VX nerve agent was rubbed on his face at Kuala Lumpur airport.   Are these the only US sanctions against Russia? No. In June the US imposed sanctions on five Russian companies and three Russian individuals in response to alleged Russian cyber-attacks on the US. All are prohibited from any transactions involving the US financial system. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the measures were to counter "malicious actors" working to "increase Russia\'s offensive cyber-capabilities". Russia likely to resist Analysis by Gary O\'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington After pressure from Republican members of Congress, the state department has determined Moscow broke international law by using a military grade chemical weapon on the Skripals.  While the US expelled some five dozen diplomats shortly after the poisoning, the administration stopped short of making a formal determination that Russia had broken international law.  But Congress has been pushing for such a decision and now the state department has confirmed Russia\'s actions contravened 1991 US legislation on the use of chemical weapons.  That breach automatically triggers the imposition of sanctions and places requirements on Russia to avert further restrictions in three months time.  Those requirements could include opening up sites in Russia for inspection - a move Moscow would probably resist.  So far President Donald Trump has been silent on this latest move - which could well derail his attempts to develop a new, warmer relationship with Vladimir Putin. What was the nerve agent? Following the incident, the British government said the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, of a type developed by Russia, had been used in the attack.  Relations between Russia and the West hit a new low. More than 20 countries expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, including the US. Washington ordered 60 diplomats to leave and closed the Russian consulate general in Seattle. Three months after the Salisbury attack, two other people fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from the city.  Dawn Sturgess later died while her partner, Charlie Rowley, spent three weeks recovering in hospital. After tests, scientists at the UK\'s military research lab, Porton Down, found the couple had also been exposed to Novichok. Mr Rowley  told ITV News  he had earlier found a sealed bottle of perfume and given it to Ms Sturgess, who sprayed the substance on her wrists.', 'category': 'news', 'date': '9 August 2018'}

{'title': "Brad Pitt hits back at Angelina Jolie's child support claims", 'author': '', 'body': 'US actor Brad Pitt has rebutted claims made by his estranged wife Angelina Jolie that he has failed to support their children. In a court filing on Wednesday, the star\'s legal team said he had paid more than $1.3m (£1m) in costs and loaned $8m to Jolie to help her buy a house. On Tuesday, Jolie\'s lawyer said Pitt had paid "no meaningful child support" since she filed for divorce in 2016. The couple had been together since 2005 but only married in 2014. In the documents, Pitt\'s lawyers also said Jolie\'s claims regarding child support were a "thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage." There has been no immediate response from Jolie\'s representatives. "[Pitt] has a statutory duty to pay child support. As of present, [he] has paid no meaningful child support since separation," her lawyer said in the filing on Tuesday. "Given that the informal arrangements around the payment of the children\'s expenses have not been regularly sustained... for over a year and a half, [Jolie] intends to file... for the establishment of a retroactive child support order," the documents stated. Jolie cited "irreconcilable differences" when she filed to end the marriage, and the pair became embroiled in a bitter child custody dispute in the months following the announcement. Pitt was investigated for possible child abuse  after losing his temper in front of some of the children, but was later cleared of the allegations. The couple were known as "Brangelina" by fans and met on the set of the 2005 film Mr and Mrs Smith. The marriage was Pitt\'s second, having previously wed Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie\'s third after actors Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller.', 'category': 'news', 'date': '8 August 2018'}

{'title': 'Will the first Ikea in India succeed?', 'author': '', 'body': 'Swedish furniture giant Ikea has opened its first store in India in the southern city of Hyderabad. With a growing middle class, India could be a big opportunity for the company, but it\'s also a market with many quirks. Ikea\'s giant blue store sits on a 13-acre campus, by the side of a busy road, in HITEC city. The technology hub in Hyderabad that is also home to global firms like Microsoft, Google and Facebook. The scale of the shop is something that has never been seen in India before. Its size alone has piqued curiosity among those who may have never heard of the brand. And then of course, there are so many who have. Upwardly mobile, well-travelled Indians have known Ikea for a while now. In fact, with the number of global retailers who\'ve come to India over the past decade, some would say Ikea has taken its time to set up shop here.  The company\'s global chief executive Jesper Brodin said: "The market of India for us is a dream. "But to be honest, some years ago, when we looked into the business case of India, we felt it was too high risk from the cost perspective [of] not meeting our targets." So, what changed? Government policies, for one. In 2012, India allowed 100% foreign direct investment in single-brand retail. This was important for Ikea, because it didn\'t want to go down the joint venture route.  The emergence and rapid growth of e-commerce is another reason why Ikea sees more of an opportunity in India now. In fact, even as it works on expanding its brick and mortar presence, the company wants to start selling its wares online in the country by next year.  "They\'ve been very patient about India. In terms of the amount of effort and time that they have taken to launch the first store, it\'s unusual actually," said Arvind Singhal from consulting firm Technopak Advisors. "It shows to me a determination to get it right in the market." And Ikea has taken care to adapt to India. Around the world, Ikea purchases arrive in customer homes in the famed "flat-pack". Stripping out the parts and assembling the furniture is a "do-it-yourself" job. That\'s not something Indians are used to. The availability of cheap labour in the country means people here rely on workmen or carpenters to do that.  "We will argue a little bit with our customers to say - would you please consider the do-it-yourself model? "And the whole point of that is that you save money by doing that," says Mr Brodin. "But we are not naive, and also in other markets we offer services, for home deliveries, for kitchen installations. and in India we believe that need will be slightly more than the average market. "So here we have signed up with companies, experts, but also a social entrepreneurship network with people that will be able to get great jobs in serving customers with assembling." They\'ve also changed the other thing Ikea\'s so well known for - Swedish meatballs. At the store\'s 1,000-seater restaurant - its largest in the world - they are available. But they aren\'t traditional meatballs made of beef and pork. That could offend religious sentiments here, and so there are chicken and vegetarian meatballs on offer. As are some Indian dishes like biryani and dal makhani. But finally, whether or not people will actually shop at Ikea all comes down to one thing - price.  "Indians are very price sensitive, but they\'re also value sensitive. You can\'t give them substandard quality at cheaper rates. They want both," says Paresh Parekh, partner at Ersnt & Young. "Indians lose trust very fast, so I think they will have to get it right the first time, in terms of price, quality and experience." It\'s something Ikea\'s leadership seems to have taken into account.  "In India, we\'ve gone all in as much as we can, and that means out of the 7,500 products that we have here, we\'ve worked very hard, to have 1,000 products with a price of Rs. 200 ($3, £2.30) or less and 500 products for less than Rs. 100\', said Mr Brodin. "With that offer, this is one of the price-attractive markets that we\'re opening." But India throws up other challenges. Huge tracts of land, to offer the true Ikea experience, are hard to find in most big cities. If they are available, they\'re expensive. High import duties are another problem. And keeping prices low means it\'ll take longer to make money back. Ikea has so far said it\'s investing $1.5bn in India. Mr Brodin admitted it\'s going to be hard. "The investments are high and the time until which you reach an economy of scale will be a stretch for us, but we will try to endure," he said.  From Thursday, they\'ll be watching with bated breath to see how India reacts to Ikea.', 'category': 'news', 'date': '9 August 2018'}

{'title': 'Sky News Australia pulled from train stations over backlash', 'author': '', 'body': 'An Australian state has instructed train stations to stop broadcasting Sky News Australia, amid a widening backlash over a recent TV interview. On Sunday, Sky News Australia hosted Blair Cottrell - a far-right figure with court convictions - in its studio. It drew much public anger . Many pointed out that he had once called for schools to display images of Adolf Hitler. On Thursday, Victoria said that the channel would no longer be played at train stations in central Melbourne. "Hatred and racism have no place on our screens or in our community," tweeted Transport Minister Jacinta Allen. Cottrell used his interview to call on Australia to reduce immigration, protect itself from "foreign ideologies" and to "reclaim our traditional identity". Sky News Australia has said it was "wrong" to interview Cottrell on The Adam Giles Show. It has since suspended the programme. How the backlash unfolded Last year, Cottrell was one of three men found guilty by a magistrate of inciting contempt of Muslims, after the men staged a mock beheading to protest against the building of a mosque. He was previously convicted of other offences, including arson and burglary. Many critics of the interview pointed out this history. But much anger centred on comments he had made on social media, especially about Nazism and women. "Blair Cottrell is a far right-wing fascist who\'s a self confessed Hitler fan. He\'s boasted about using \'violence and terror\' to manipulate women," tweeted one critic, Laura Jayes, a Sky News Australia presenter. The backlash intensified when Jayes posted a screenshot of a tweet by Cottrell, in which he talked about hypothetically raping her on air.  One commentator, Craig Emerson, said he would no longer appear on the network, while brands American Express, Specsavers and Huggies all pulled advertising. Victoria accused of \'censorship\' Ms Allan described the interview as "the final straw" for the network, telling local radio 3AW: "There have been a number of interviews that had started to go down a slippery slope." She cited one recent interview in which  a senator was accused of making sexist slurs . Although Ms Allan\'s announcement was welcomed by some observers, others suggested it may have gone too far. "Banning Sky from broadcasting at Victorian rail stations is absurd. The daytime line up… is professional and first rate," tweeted academic and journalist Peter van Onselen. Other commentators said it was an act of "censorship".  New South Wales, which also broadcasts Sky News Australia at train stations, has said it will not follow Victoria\'s move.', 'category': 'news', 'date': '9 August 2018'}

He died on Wednesday, after spending his final days with family and friends in the state of Victoria, Golf Australia said in a statement. Lyle reached a career-high 142nd in the world, and won twice on the Nationwide Tour in 2008. He last competed in 2017. His wife, Briony Lyle, said that he had been "overwhelmed" by recent support. "He asked that I provide a simple message: \'Thanks for your support, it meant the world. My time was short, but if I\'ve helped people think and act on behalf of those families who suffer through cancer, hopefully it wasn\'t wasted.\'" He is survived by Ms Lyle, and their daughters Lusi, six, and Jemma, two. "Lusi, Jemma and I are filled with grief and now must confront our lives without the greatest husband and father we could ever have wished for," Ms Lyle said in a statement.

{'title': 'Lombok earthquake: Strong tremor amid rescue efforts', 'author': '', 'body': 'The Indonesian island of Lombok has been hit by a strong tremor, as it still reels from the impact of Sunday\'s earthquake. The USGS said the latest quake had a magnitude of 5.9 - there are reports it brought down some buildings. Rescue workers are still digging through rubble and trying to get aid to victims of the earlier, larger quake. The Red Cross has said that incident, which killed at least 131 people, was "exceptionally destructive". Some villages had "completely collapsed", said a Red Cross official in Lombok, Christopher Rassi. The official death toll stands at 131 , but local media are reporting figures as high as 347. The government says more than 1,400 people were injured and more than 156,000 displaced. The national disaster agency said all those numbers were likely to increase, as more information comes in and more victims are found.  The new tremor hit off the north-west coast of Lombok. Reuters said it sent people running in to the streets in panic. Indonesia\'s meteorological agency put the magnitude at 6.2. No tsunami warning has been issued.  It is likely to have been the strongest of the more than 340 aftershocks in the area since Sunday.  Emergency workers are continuing to dig through rubble and are gradually starting to reach more remote areas of the large island. But the spokesman for Indonesia\'s national disaster agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said some areas in the north had still not received any aid. Masih pengungsi yang belum tersentuh bantuan untuk korban gempa di Lombok khususnya di Lombok Utara dan Lombok Barat. Kerusakan bangunan masif di Lombok Utara. Perlu upaya keras untuk segera menyalurkan bantuan.  pic.twitter.com/nHheUGMLny End of Twitter post  by @Sutopo_PN Lombok is a roughly 4,500 sq km (1,700 sq miles) island east of the slightly larger island of Bali. Most people live in basic housing in small communities. Tens of thousands are now sleeping out in the open or in the ruins of their homes.  "We are still waiting for assessments from some of the more remote areas in the north of the island, but it is already clear that Sunday\'s earthquake was exceptionally destructive," said Mr Rassi. "I visited villages yesterday that were completely collapsed," he said, while other teams in East and North Lombok had reported villages where 75% of homes were damaged. With hospitals and clinics also affected, many of the injured have had to be treated in the open air or in makeshift clinics. Sunday\'s quake came only days after a slightly smaller one, which killed at least 16 people. There are growing concerns that the important tourism industry will be badly hit at what should be a busy time.  Thousands of tourists visiting Lombok - as well as the nearby Gili Islands and Bali - have been evacuated or have chosen to leave since the weekend. "We\'ve had light earthquakes in the past, but never anything like this," hotel chain owner Marcel De Rijk told Reuters. "We\'ve lost a lot of bookings and future guests are in wait-and-see mode. I don\'t think people will choose Lombok anymore this summer." The quake struck at 19:46 local time (11:46 GMT) on Sunday at a fairly shallow depth of 31km (19 miles). Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. More than half of the world\'s active volcanoes above sea level are part of the ring.', 'category': 'news', 'date': '9 August 2018'}

{'title': 'Argentina abortion: Senate defeats bill legalising it at up to 14 weeks', 'author': '', 'body': 'Argentina\'s senate has rejected a bill which would have legalised abortion in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. After a marathon debate, 38 senators voted against it and 31 in favour. Its defeat means lawmakers must wait until next year to resubmit legislation. Currently abortion is allowed in Argentina only in cases of rape, or if the mother\'s health is in danger. Demonstrators on both sides of the debate rallied outside parliament as voting took place.  Anti-abortion activists have been jubilant. "What this vote showed is that Argentina is still a country that represents family values," one told the Reuters news agency. But pro-choice campaigners, many of them dressed in green to show their support for the cause, were seen crying and comforting each other.  Pro-choice campaigners have for years tried to get bills passed, but their efforts gained new impetus when President Mauricio Macri - who opposes abortion - called on Congress to consider it.  In June, the lower house narrowly passed after a session lasting nearly 24 hours while hundreds of thousands of women held a vigil outside.

{'title': 'Gaza air strikes ‘kill woman and child’ after rockets hit Israel', 'author': '', 'body': 'Three Palestinians are reported to have been killed in a series of Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip, after militants there fired dozens of rockets into southern Israel.  Gaza health ministry officials said a pregnant woman and her daughter, aged one, were killed in the Jafarawi area. A Hamas militant also died in the north, health officials said. Israeli media said several civilians were hurt by rocket fire in Sderot and other towns near the Gaza border. The violence came as the UN and Egypt attempted to broker a long-term ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the militant Islamist group that dominates Gaza. UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov said he was "deeply alarmed". "Our collective efforts have prevented the situation from exploding until now. If the current escalation however is not contained immediately, the situation can rapidly deteriorate with devastating consequences for all people," he warned.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the violence broke out after militants shot at an IDF vehicle in Gaza on Wednesday. After Israel responded with tank fire, dozens of rockets were sent toward Israeli territory on Wednesday night. Hamas\'s military wing said it was behind the rocket attacks. Earlier this week  two of its militants were killed after Israel shelled a Hamas border post in northern Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces Twitter account said its fighter jets had targeted more 140 strategic sites, including a weapons manufacturing and storage facility.  "The Israeli strike was conducted in response to the rockets launched from the Gaza Strip at Israeli territory over the course of the evening and night," it said. It said about 150 rockets had been launched from Gaza towards Israeli territory. Israeli television broadcast images of damage to homes and cars in the town of Sderot. The cross-border violence comes soon after a delegation of senior Hamas officials visited Gaza to discuss a ceasefire agreement with Israel proposed by Egypt and the UN. On Wednesday, UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov condemned the Hamas rocket fire and called for both sides to step away from the brink. The last four months have seen an upsurge in violence along the Gaza-Israel border. More than 160 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces - most during weekly protests at which thousands of Palestinians have expressed their support for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. Human rights groups have accused Israeli troops of using excessive force at the protests, but the military said they only opened fire in self-defence or on people trying to infiltrate its territory. One Israeli soldier has been shot dead by a Palestinian sniper during the same period, while incendiary devices attached to balloons and kites launched by Palestinians have sparked hundreds of fires in southern Israel, burning some 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) of forest and farmland.', 'category': 'news', 'date': '9 August 2018'}
